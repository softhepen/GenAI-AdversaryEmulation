Based on the provided documentation and the objective to simulate the attack behavior, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool pupy to reproduce the following attack behavior:

**Attack Description:** The bot collects credentials from various software, which can include valid accounts for different services.

**Command: `run Lazagne`**

This command uses the Lazagne module to retrieve passwords stored on the system (Windows/Linux) and store them in the local db.
