Based on the documentation and the attack description, I will generate a realistic command line that simulates OS Credential Dumping using the Windows Credentials Editor tool.

Here is my output:

Command: `wce -w`

This command dumps cleartext passwords stored by the Digest Authentication package, as described in the attack description. The `-w` option is used to dump these credentials.

Note: This command does not require any additional parameters or file paths, so I have not inserted any placeholders.
