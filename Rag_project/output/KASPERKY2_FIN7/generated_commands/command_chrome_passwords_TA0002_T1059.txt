Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using the chrome-passwords tool to simulate the GRIFFON implant's execution.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -c`
This command displays saved passwords as well as cookies in a format that includes host keys, paths, and cookie values. This is useful for simulating the GRIFFON implant's ability to access and manipulate browser data.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -p > output.txt`
This command disables waiting for random input at the end and outputs the results to a file named "output.txt". This simulates the GRIFFON implant's ability to execute commands quickly without user interaction.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords url \n username \n password`
This command displays saved passwords in a format that includes URLs, usernames, and passwords. This is useful for simulating the GRIFFON implant's ability to access and manipulate browser data.

Note: The above commands are designed to simulate the behavior of the GRIFFON implant as described in the attack description, using only the documented syntax and capabilities of the chrome-passwords tool.
