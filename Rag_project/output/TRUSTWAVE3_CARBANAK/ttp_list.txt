- Tactic: TA0001 – INITIAL ACCESS
  Technique: T1566 – PHISHING
  Description: In each campaign, a malicious Word or RTF document was sent to specific employees. This is a form of spearphishing where the attacker targets specific individuals with malicious attachments to gain initial access. This technique involves using social engineering over a phone call to persuade the victim to open a malicious email attachment. The attacker's follow-up call to confirm the document was opened adds another layer of social engineering to ensure the malicious payload is executed.
- Tactic: TA0003 – PERSISTENCE
  Technique: T1204 – USER EXECUTION
  Description: This technique involves tricking the user into executing a file that contains malicious code.
  Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
  Description: Using scheduled tasks to execute programs or scripts at specific times or intervals.
  Technique: T1543 – CREATE OR MODIFY SYSTEM PROCESS
  Description: Persistence is established by creating a scheduled task
- Tactic: TA0009 – COLLECTION
  Technique: T1113 – SCREEN CAPTURE
  Description: Taking screenshots of the victim's desktop to capture sensitive information displayed on the screen. Taking screenshots of the victim's desktop to capture sensitive information displayed on the screen.
  Technique: T1022 – DATA ENCRYPTED FOR IMPACT
  Description: The adversary encrypts files and data to make them inaccessible to users and applications and potentially to exfiltrate information from the victim's network.
- Tactic: TA0002 – EXECUTION
  Technique: T1059 – COMMAND AND SCRIPTING INTERPRETER
  Description: There are two VBS scripts There are four more VBS scripts Using command-line interfaces to execute commands. Run VBS This technique involves using PowerShell to execute commands and scripts. The described behavior of using a PowerShell script to handle a base64-encoded payload is a common use case of PowerShell for malicious activities. PowerShell script file created from a base64 encoded string hidden in a Word document
  Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
  Description: Using scheduled tasks to execute programs or scripts at specific times or intervals.
  Technique: T1047 – WINDOWS MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTATION
  Description: Adversaries use Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to obtain information.
- Tactic: TA0004 – PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
  Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
  Description: Using scheduled tasks to execute programs or scripts at specific times or intervals.
  Technique: T1055 – PROCESS INJECTION
  Description: dversaries inject code into the address space of another process to execute their payload. Reflective DLL injection is a method of process injection where a DLL is loaded into the address space of a process without the use of traditional Windows APIs. This technique involves injecting code into the memory space of another process. The action of writing the decoded payload into memory and executing it as a thread aligns with process injection techniques.
- Tactic: TA0007 – DISCOVERY
  Technique: T1082 – SYSTEM INFORMATION DISCOVERY
  Description: The adversary gathers information about the system.
  Technique: T1057 – PROCESS DISCOVERY DESCRIPTION
  Description: The adversary attempts to get a listing of running processes on a system.
  Technique: T1046 – NETWORK SERVICE SCANNING
  Description: Adversaries use network service scanning to locate systems and services that are accessible over the network.
- Tactic: TA0010 – EXFILTRATION
  Technique: T1041 – EXFILTRATION OVER C2 CHANNEL
  Description: The adversary uses an existing command and control channel to exfiltrate data.
- Tactic: TA0011 – COMMAND AND CONTROL
  Technique: T1071 – APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL
  Description: the malware uses \"http POST\" to send data
  Technique: T1105 – INGRESS TOOL TRANSFER
  Description: Adversaries may transfer tools or files to the victim's system to perform further actions or operations. This technique involves moving executables or other files to the target system. Transferring tools or files to the victim's system. This encompasses the initial transfer of the Meterpreter DLL.
- Tactic: TA0005 – DEFENSE EVASION
  Technique: T1055 – PROCESS INJECTION
  Description: dversaries inject code into the address space of another process to execute their payload. Reflective DLL injection is a method of process injection where a DLL is loaded into the address space of a process without the use of traditional Windows APIs. This technique involves injecting code into the memory space of another process. The action of writing the decoded payload into memory and executing it as a thread aligns with process injection techniques.
  Technique: T1027 – OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION
  Description: This technique includes various methods of obfuscating files or data to avoid detection. Base64 encoding is a common method of obfuscation used to hide the contents of a payload. This technique includes various methods of obfuscating files or data to avoid detection. Base64 encoding is a common method of obfuscation used to hide the contents of a payload.
