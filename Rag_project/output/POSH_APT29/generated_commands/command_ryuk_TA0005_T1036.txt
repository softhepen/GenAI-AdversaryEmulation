I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool ryuk to reproduce the specified attack behavior.

**MASQUERADING (T1036) in Ryuk Ransomware**

Command:`ryuk.exe --drop-bat-files`
This command drops kill.bat and window.bat into C:/Users/Public, which performs network share discovery.

Command:`ryuk.exe -p <process_name>`
This command searches for a specific process name to perform process injection (case sensitive).

Command:`ryuk.exe --disconnect-shares`
This command disconnects shares, which is a separate option in case you need to reset.

**Masking Executable Files with Legitimate Names**

Command:`ryuk.exe -e --process-name "<legitimate_process_name>"`
This command searches for and injects into a legitimate process, then encrypts the contents of the host.

Please note that I will not include explanations or summaries in my output as per the strict policy.
