Based on the internal tools and technique descriptions provided, here is the analysis:

- Tactic: TA0009 – COLLECTION
Technique: T1056 – INPUT CAPTURE
Description: Cybercriminals used cameras to record the PINs people
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1185 – BROWSER SESSION HIJACKING
Description: JS snifing (MageCarting) involves injecting malicious JavaScript into a website, often through compromised third-party services or direct website exploits. This allows attackers to intercept and steal payment card data directly from users interacting with the website.
Tool: chrome-passwords

- Tactic: TA0006 – CREDENTIAL ACCESS
Technique: T1056 – INPUT CAPTURE
Description: Cybercriminals used cameras to record the PINs people
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0002 – EXECUTION
Technique: T1059 – COMMAND AND SCRIPTING INTERPRETER
Description: Attackers use these interpreters to execute malicious commands on compromised systems. Attackers use these interpreters to execute malicious commands on compromised systems.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1203 – EXPLOITATION FOR CLIENT EXECUTION
Description: This technique is used in conjunction with Cobalt Strike (Cobalt/Meterpreter) to exploit vulnerabilities and execute payloads on targeted systems, especially in post-exploitation scenarios. The use of well-known Microsoft Office exploits generated by exploitation frameworks is a common tactic. These exploits do not require zero-day vulnerabilities but instead rely on the fact that many systems remain unpatched against older, well-documented flaws. Documents with exploits are used to execute malicious code on the victim's system. These documents typically exploit vulnerabilities in software like Microsoft Office to gain initial access.
Tool: metasploit

- Tactic: TA0001 – INITIAL ACCESS
Technique: T1566 – PHISHING
Description: These groups use effective spear-phishing campaigns with malicious Microsoft Office documents to deliver their payloads.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0011 – COMMAND AND CONTROL
Technique: T1105 – INGRESS TOOL TRANSFER
Description: The initial exploit is designed to load a small downloader, which then downloads additional malicious components (such as the Cobalt beacon) from an external server.
Tool: metasploit
