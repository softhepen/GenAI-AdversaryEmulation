Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate a realistic command line using only the Ryuk tool to reproduce the attack behavior.

The attack behavior is to shutdown/reboot systems to interrupt access or aid in the destruction of those systems. This corresponds to Technique ID T1529 and Tactic ID TA0040.

Here is the generated command line:
Command: `ryuk.exe /shutdown`

This command uses the Ryuk tool's documented syntax and capabilities to simulate the attack behavior, specifically the shutdown/reboot functionality.
