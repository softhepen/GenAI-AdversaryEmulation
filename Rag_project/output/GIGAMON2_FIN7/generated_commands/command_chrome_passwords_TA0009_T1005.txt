Based on the documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using the **chrome-passwords** tool to simulate the memory scraping behavior.

Here is my output:

Command: `chrome-passwords -p`

This command uses the `-p` option to extract locally saved passwords and cookies from Google Chrome. The goal is to recover sensitive data (e.g., payment card information) directly from the memory of running processes, which corresponds to the T1005 technique.

Note that I have not included any additional parameters or file paths, as they are not explicitly specified in the attack description. If required, I can add placeholders for such values.
