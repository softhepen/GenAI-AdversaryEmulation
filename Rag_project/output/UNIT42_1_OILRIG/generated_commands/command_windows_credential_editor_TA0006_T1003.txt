Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) tool to reproduce the specified behavior.

**Command:** `wce -g <password>` 

This command generates LM & NT Hash from a given password. The `<password>` placeholder needs to be replaced with the actual password.

**Command:** `wce -K` 

This command dumps Kerberos tickets to file in both Unix and Windows WCE form at.

**Command:** `wce -k <file_path>` 

This command reads Kerberos tickets from a file and inserts them into the Windows cache. The `<file_path>` placeholder needs to be replaced with the actual path of the file containing the Kerberos tickets.

**Command:** `wce -w` 

This command dumps cleartext passwords stored by the Digest Authentication package.

**Command:** `wce -f` 

This command forces 'safe mode' for WCE, which might be necessary to dump credentials or perform pass-the-hash attacks.

Note: These commands are based on the provided documentation and may need to be modified according to specific system configurations.
