Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the attack behavior.

Here is the output:

Command: `chrome-passwords -p`
Command: `chrome-passwords -c`
Command: `chrome-passwords url <url> username <username> password <password>`
Command: `chrome-passwords -c host_key <host_key> path <path> cookie value <cookie_value>`

Note that the placeholders `<url>`, `<username>`, `<password>`, `<host_key>`, `<path>`, and `<cookie_value>` must be replaced with actual values.

These command lines aim to simulate the attack behavior by:

1. Retrieving saved passwords without waiting for random input at the end (using `-p` flag).
2. Showing both passwords and cookies (using `-c` flag).
3. Extracting specific password information (url, username, password) using placeholders.
4. Decrypting cookies with host_key, path, and cookie value.

Remember that this is a simulated attack in a controlled environment, and actual malicious activities are strictly prohibited.
