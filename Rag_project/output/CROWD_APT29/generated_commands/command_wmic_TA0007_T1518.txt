Here are the command lines that simulate the attack behavior described, using only the WMIC tool:

Command: `wmic SOFTWAREELEMENT get /value`

Command: `wmic SOFTWAREFEATURE list /format:list`

Command: `wmic SOUNDDEV get /value`

Command: `wmic STARTUP get /value`

Command: `wmic SYSACCOUNT get /value`

Command: `wmic SYSDRIVER list /format:list`

Note that these commands are designed to retrieve information about the system's software elements, features, audio devices, startup scripts, system accounts, and drivers. They do not actually execute any malicious code or perform any unauthorized actions.
