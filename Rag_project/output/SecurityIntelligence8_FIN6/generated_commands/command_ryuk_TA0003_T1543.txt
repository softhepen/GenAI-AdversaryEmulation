Based on the documentation and the provided attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool Ryuk to reproduce the following attack behavior:

**Command:** `ryuk.exe /inject <dll_name>`

This command injects a shellcode loader (updater.exe) into the system process, which is observed as updater.exe.

Note: `<dll_name>` placeholder needs to be replaced with the actual DLL name used in the attack.
