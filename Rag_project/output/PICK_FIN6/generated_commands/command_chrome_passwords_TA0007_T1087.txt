Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the behavior of identifying user accounts that could access additional hosts in the domain.

Here are the command lines:

Command: `chrome-passwords -c`

This command line uses the `-c` option to show cookies as well as passwords. This is intended to identify user accounts that have access to additional hosts in the domain by analyzing the cookies stored locally.

Note: The `<placeholder>` format is used where necessary, as per the instructions.
