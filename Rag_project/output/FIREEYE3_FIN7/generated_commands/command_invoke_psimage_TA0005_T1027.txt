Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate a realistic command line using only the tool `Invoke-PSImage`.

**Attack Description:**
The obfuscation of both the macro and JavaScript is part of this technique, where adversaries disguise their code to evade detection.

**MITRE Technique and Tactic:**
Technique ID: T1027
Technique name: OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION
Tactic ID: TA0005
Tactic name: DEFENSE EVASION

**Command Line Generation:**

After analyzing the attack description, I identified the need to encode a PowerShell script in a PNG image. I will use `Invoke-PSImage` to generate a command line that simulates this behavior.

Here is the generated command line:

Command: `Invoke-PSImage -Embed -InputFile <image_file> -OutputFile <output_png>`
