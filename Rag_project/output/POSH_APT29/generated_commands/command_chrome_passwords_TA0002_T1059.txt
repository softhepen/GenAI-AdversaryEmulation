Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the attack behavior.

Here are the command lines that simulate the described behavior:

Command: `chrome-passwords -c`

This command is used to show cookies in the format of host_key \n path \n cookie value. This simulates the use of PowerShell to execute malicious commands or scripts, as it will allow us to view and potentially manipulate the cookies stored by Google Chrome.

Command: `chrome-passwords -p > output.txt`

This command is used to disable waiting for random input at the end, which makes it useful if we want to forward the output to a file. This simulates the use of PowerShell payloads to run malicious code, as it will allow us to capture and execute commands in a file.

Command: `chrome-passwords -p | powershell.exe -file "backdoor.ps1"`

This command uses PowerShell to run a script (backdoor.ps1) that is stored in a file. This simulates the use of PowerShell to execute malicious code, as it will allow us to run scripts and execute commands.

Command: `chrome-passwords -c | powershell.exe -file "cookie_decoder.ps1"`

This command uses PowerShell to run a script (cookie_decoder.ps1) that is stored in a file. This simulates the use of PowerShell to decode and manipulate cookies, as it will allow us to view and potentially modify the cookies.

Please note that these command lines are generated based on the provided documentation and may not be actual malicious commands or scripts.
