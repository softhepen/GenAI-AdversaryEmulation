Based on the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool WMIC to reproduce process discovery behavior.

Here are my outputs:

Command: `wmic path win32_process get name`

This command uses the PROCESS class from WMI to retrieve a list of running processes and their names. This simulates the process discovery technique (T1057) by identifying running processes on a system.

Let me know if this meets your requirements!
