Based on the provided documentation and attack behavior, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool paexec to reproduce the following attack behavior:

**Download additional code to execute**

Command: `paexec -c "C:\Path\To\AdditionalCode.exe" -lo C:\Temp\PAExec.log`

This command line uses the `-c` option to copy the specified program (additional code) to the remote system for execution. The `-lo` option is used to log output to a file.

**Download additional code to execute**

Command: `paexec -csrc "C:\Path\To\AdditionalCode.exe" -dfr`

This command line uses the `-csrc` option to specify an alternate path to copy the program from, and the `-dfr` option to disable WOW64 File Redirection for the new process.

Please note that I've used placeholders `<C:\Path\To\AdditionalCode.exe>` which should be replaced with actual file paths or names.
