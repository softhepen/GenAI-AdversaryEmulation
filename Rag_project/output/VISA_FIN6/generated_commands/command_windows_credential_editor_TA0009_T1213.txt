Here are the command lines to simulate the attack behavior:

Command: `windows-credential-editor -K`

This command is used to dump Kerberos tickets from Windows machines, including the TGT (Ticket-Granting Ticket).

Command: `windows-credential-editor -k <kerberos_ticket_file>`

This command reads Kerberos tickets from a file and inserts them into the Windows cache.

Command: `windows-credential-editor -g "<password>"`

This command generates LM & NT Hashes for a given password.

Command: `windows-credential-editor -w`

This command dumps cleartext passwords stored by the Windows Digest Authentication security package.

Since we are not provided with specific parameters, I will insert clear placeholders in the command lines using the format <placeholder>:

Command: `windows-credential-editor -f`

This command is used to force 'safe mode' for the tool.

Please note that these command lines are based on the documentation provided and do not include explanations or summaries.
