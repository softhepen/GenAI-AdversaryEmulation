Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines to simulate the attack behavior described in the execution instructions.

Here is the first command line:

Command: `wce -e`

This command uses the `-e` option to list logon sessions and their associated NTLM credentials indefinitely. This simulates the behavior of Trickbot querying registry for saved credentials, as it will continuously refresh the output whenever a new logon event occurs.

Please let me know if this meets your requirements or if you need any further modifications!
