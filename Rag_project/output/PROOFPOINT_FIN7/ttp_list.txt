- Tactic: TA0005 – DEFENSE EVASION
  Technique: T1497 – VIRTUALIZATION/SANDBOX EVASION
  Description: FIN7's Bateleur backdoor and the updated macros use sophisticated methods to detect and evade sandboxes or analysis environments. This technique involves malware checking the environment for signs of being run in a virtualized or sandboxed environment to avoid detection or analysis. Common checks include identifying virtual machines or sandbox-specific indicators.
  Technique: T1027 – OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION
  Description: FIN7 changed their obfuscation techniques in the document attachments to hide malicious content. The adversary uses obfuscation to hide malicious code or make it harder to analyze.
  Technique: T1070 – INDICATOR REMOVAL ON HOST
  Description: The macro writes the extracted JScript payload to the debug.txt file in the temporary folder, likely with the intent to delete this file after execution to evade detection and forensic analysis. his involves removing files that may indicate malicious activity, such as deleting scheduled tasks or other artifacts after they have been executed to avoid detection. Removing installation file and path and remove scheduled tasks. removing the temporary command file removing the temporary command file
  Technique: T1036 – MASQUERADING
  Description: a legitimate name is used for the scheduled task
  Technique: T1218 – SIGNED SCRIPT PROXY EXECUTION
  Description: a regsvr32 command is written to a file and then executed.

  Technique: T1497 – VIRTUALIZATION/SANDBOX EVASION
  Description: FIN7's Bateleur backdoor and the updated macros use sophisticated methods to detect and evade sandboxes or analysis environments. This technique involves malware checking the environment for signs of being run in a virtualized or sandboxed environment to avoid detection or analysis. Common checks include identifying virtual machines or sandbox-specific indicators.
  Technique: T1082 – SYSTEM INFORMATION DISCOVERY
  Description: The malware gathers information about the infected system. This technique involves gathering information about the system to better understand the environment or to gather information useful for further attacks. This can include details like the computer name, operating system, and more.
