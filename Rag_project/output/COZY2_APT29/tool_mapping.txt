After analyzing the internal tools and techniques, I found the following matches:

- Tactic: TA0001 – INITIAL ACCESS
Technique: T1566 – PHISHING
Description: Sending spearphishing emails with links to a compromised website. Sending spearphishing emails with phony flash videos as attachments.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1189 – DRIVE-BY COMPROMISE
Description: Using a legitimate website (in this case "diplomacy.pl") to host a ZIP archive containing a malicious executable.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0002 – EXECUTION
Technique: T1204 – USER EXECUTION
Description: Using a self-extracting RAR file (RAR SFX) that, when executed by the user, installs the malware. The user runs a malicious executable file, presumably the fake money video (cash video). The user voluntarily runs the executable file Monkeys.exe to play the chimpanzee video.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1047 – WINDOWS MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTATION
Description: Adversaries may abuse Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) to execute malicious commands and payloads.
Tool: WMIC

Technique: T1059 – COMMAND AND SCRIPTING INTERPRETER
Description: attackers can execute shell commands through `cmd_task.dll`, allowing direct control and interaction with the victim's system.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0011 – COMMAND AND CONTROL
Technique: T1105 – INGRESS TOOL TRANSFER
Description: Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system into a compromised environment. Adversaries may transfer tools or other files from an external system into a compromised environment.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1573 – ENCRYPTED CHANNEL
Description: collected data communications were encrypted
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1132 – DATA ENCODING
Description: The data are encoded in BASE64 to hide their true content.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1071 – APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL
Description: Adversaries may communicate using OSI application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0005 – DEFENSE EVASION
Technique: T1036 – MASQUERADING
Description: The malware masquerades as a legitimate media file (in this case a money video) to trick the user. The malware masquerades as a harmless funny chimpanzee video to fool the user.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1027 – OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION
Description: The player.exe dropper uses anti-detection techniques to avoid detection. The malware uses an encrypted CAB file that is decompressed and whose contents are created on the disk.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1218 – SYSTEM BINARY PROXY EXECUTION
Description: The malware uses files signed with a digital signature (in this case, AMD's digital signature) to execute other malicious files. Adversaries may bypass process and/or signature-based defenses by proxying execution of malicious content with signed, or otherwise trusted, binaries.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0007 – DISCOVERY
Technique: T1082 – SYSTEM INFORMATION DISCOVERY
Description: The malicious file collects system information to understand the environment in which it is executed. An adversary may attempt to get detailed information about the operating system and hardware, including version, patches, hotfixes, service packs, and architecture.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1012 – QUERY REGISTRY
Description: The malware performs a registry search, specifically in the registry key "SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall," to locate installed security products.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1071 – APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL
Description: Adversaries may communicate using OSI application layer protocols to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0040 – IMPACT
Technique: T1486 – DATA ENCRYPTED
Description: The malware uses an XOR encryption algorithm with a 16-byte rotating key to encrypt and decrypt a CAB file containing malware. The malware uses the RC4 encryption algorithm to encrypt the "racss.dat" configuration file on the disk. Data encoded in BASE64 is encrypted with the RC4 algorithm using the same encryption key as the malware configuration file.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0009 – COLLECTION
Technique: T1074 – DATA STAGED
Description: C&Cs temporarily store commands and new forms until the victim reconnects to retrieve local files. "Reporting" files maintain stolen system information, error output, and "AgentInfo" output from victim systems.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1113 – SCREEN CAPTURE
Description: `screenshot_task.dll` is a 32-bit DLL used to capture a screenshot of the full desktop window and save it as a bitmap in the %temp% directory.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0010 – EXFILTRATION
Technique: T1041 – EXFILTRATION OVER C2 CHANNEL
Description: Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an existing command and control channel.
Tool: No tool
