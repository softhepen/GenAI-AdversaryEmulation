Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using only the WMIC tool to reproduce the attack behavior of pinging a C2 server.

Here is the output:

Command: `wmic /node:<c2_server_ip> /namespace:\\root\cimv2 path Win32_PingResult call Ping`

Note that I used the `/node` switch to specify the IP address of the C2 server, and the `/namespace` switch to specify the namespace (`\\root\cimv2`) where the WMI object is located. The `path` command specifies the class of objects to be manipulated (in this case, `Win32_PingResult`). Finally, the `call` command executes the `Ping` method on the specified object.

Please note that I did not include any specific parameters like file paths, ports, registry keys, or URLs as they are not mentioned in the attack description.
