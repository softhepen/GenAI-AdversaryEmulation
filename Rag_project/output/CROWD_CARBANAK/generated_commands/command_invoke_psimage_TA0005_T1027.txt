Based on the attack description and the documentation of the tool, I will generate a realistic command line that simulates the behavior of obfuscating files or information to avoid detection.

Here is my output:

Command: `Invoke-PSImage -Embed -OutputPath <obfuscated_file_path> -InputFile <original_file_path>`

In this command, I am using the `-Embed` option to embed the payload in an existing image file. The `-OutputPath` parameter specifies the path where the obfuscated image file will be saved, and the `-InputFile` parameter specifies the original file that needs to be obfuscated.

Note: Replace `<obfuscated_file_path>` with the actual path where you want to save the obfuscated image file and `<original_file_path>` with the actual path of the original file you want to obfuscate.
