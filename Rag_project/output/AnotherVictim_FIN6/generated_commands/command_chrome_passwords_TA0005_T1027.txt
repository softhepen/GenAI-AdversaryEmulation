Based on the provided documentation and the objective to generate realistic command lines, I will create a set of commands that simulate the attack behavior described.

Here are the command lines:

Command: `chrome-passwords`
Command: `chrome-passwords -p`
Command: `chrome-passwords -c`

These commands correspond to the following actions:
- `chrome-passwords`: Display saved passwords as follows: url \n username \n password
- `-p chrome-passwords`: Disable waiting for random input at the end, useful if you want to forward to the output to a file like `chrome-passwords.exe -p > output`
- `-c chrome-passwords`: Show also cookies as follows: host_key \n path \n cookie value

These commands are designed to reproduce the attack behavior described, which is to make an executable or file difficult to discover.
