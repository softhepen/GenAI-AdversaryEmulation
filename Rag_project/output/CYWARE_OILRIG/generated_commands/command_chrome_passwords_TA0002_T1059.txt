I'll generate realistic command lines using the chrome-passwords tool to simulate the attack behavior described.

Here are the command lines:

Command: `chrome-passwords -c`
Command: `chrome-passwords -p`
Command: `chrome-passwords`

Note: I've used placeholders for any required parameters or file names that were not specified in the attack description.
