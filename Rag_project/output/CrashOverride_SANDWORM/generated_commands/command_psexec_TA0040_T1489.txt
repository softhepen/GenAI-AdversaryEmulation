Here are some command lines that simulate the attack behavior described, using only the PsExec tool and its documented syntax:

Command: `psexec \\remote_system -s -accepteula -nobanner cmd /c "net stop <service_name>"`

Command: `psexec \\remote_system -l -accepteula -nobanner cmd /c "sc stop <service_name>"`

Command: `psexec \\remote_system -r <remote_service> -accepteula -nobanner cmd /c "net stop <service_name>"`

Note:

* `<remote_system>` should be replaced with the actual IP address or hostname of the remote system.
* `<service_name>` should be replaced with the actual name of the service to be stopped (e.g., "winmgmt", "spooler", etc.).
* `<remote_service>` should be replaced with the actual name of the remote service to interact with (if applicable).

These command lines use various options and flags from the PsExec documentation, such as `-s` for running as system account, `-l` for running as limited user, `-accepteula` and `-nobanner` for suppressing license dialog and startup banner, respectively. The `net stop` or `sc stop` commands are used to stop a service on the remote system.

Please let me know if these command lines meet your requirements!
