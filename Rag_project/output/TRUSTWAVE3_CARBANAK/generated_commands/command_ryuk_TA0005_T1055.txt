Based on the provided documentation, I will generate command lines that simulate the attack behavior described in the Pre-Requirements section.

Here are the command lines:
```
Command: `ryuk.exe /inject <dll_name> <process_id>`
Command: `ryuk.exe /mount <share_name> <drive_letter>`
Command: `ryuk.exe /stop_services <service_names>`
Command: `ryuk.exe /delete_backups <backup_paths>`
Command: `ryuk.exe /encrypt_files <file_paths> RYUKTM`
```
Note that I have used placeholders where necessary, following the format `<placeholder>` as specified in the Strict Policy. The command lines above simulate the attack behavior described in the Pre-Requirements section:

1. Injecting code into another process using the `/inject` option.
2. Mounting a share and assigning it to a drive letter using the `/mount` option.
3. Stopping services using the `/stop_services` option.
4. Deleting backups using the `/delete_backups` option.
5. Encrypting files using the `/encrypt_files` option.

Each command line is preceded by the label `Command:` and enclosed in backticks, as required by the output format.
