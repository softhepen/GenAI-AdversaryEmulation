Based on the documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the following attack behavior:

**Command:** `chrome-passwords`

This command is used to extract locally saved passwords and cookies from Google Chrome.

**Behavior:** The adversary wants to log user keystrokes to intercept credentials as the user types them. This corresponds to Technique ID: T1056 (INPUT CAPTURE) and Tactic ID: TA0009 (COLLECTION).

Here are some realistic command lines that simulate this behavior:

1. **Capturing passwords**
```
Command: `chrome-passwords -p`
```
This command captures saved passwords without waiting for random input, allowing the output to be redirected to a file or further processed.

2. **Capturing cookies**
```
Command: `chrome-passwords -c`
```
This command shows both saved passwords and cookies in the expected format (url \n username \n password and host_key \n path \n cookie value).

3. **Combining capture and output**
```
Command: `chrome-passwords -p > output.txt`
```
This command captures saved passwords without waiting for random input and redirects the output to a file named "output.txt".

These command lines accurately reproduce the attack behavior, using only the documented syntax and capabilities of the tool chrome-passwords.
