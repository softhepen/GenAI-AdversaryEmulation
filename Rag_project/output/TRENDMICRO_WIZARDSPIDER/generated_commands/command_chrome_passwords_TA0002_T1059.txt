Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the attack behavior.

**Attack Description:** Macro-enabled spreadsheet suggests Visual Basic macro used for initial payload delivery.

**MITRE Technique and Tactic:** T1059 (COMMAND AND SCRIPTING INTERPRETER) - TA0002 (EXECUTION)

Here are the generated command lines:

Command: `chrome-passwords`
Command: `chrome-passwords -p`
Command: `chrome-passwords -c`

Note: The first command will display saved passwords, the second command will disable waiting for random input at the end and forward output to a file, and the third command will show cookies as well.
