Here are the command lines that simulate the attack behavior using only the Plink tool:

Command: `plink login.example.com -l attacker_username`

Command: `plink -ssh login.example.com -l attacker_username`

Command: `plink -telnet login.example.com -l attacker_username`

Note: I've used placeholders for the username and hostname as per the output format requirements. In a real-world scenario, these would need to be replaced with actual values.
