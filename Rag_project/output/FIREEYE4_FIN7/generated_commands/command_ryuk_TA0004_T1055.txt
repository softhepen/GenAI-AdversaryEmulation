Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines to simulate the attack behavior described.

**Attack Behavior:** Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.

**MITRE Technique and Tactic:**
- Technique ID: T1055
- Technique name: PROCESS INJECTION
- Tactic ID: TA0004 
- Tactic name: PRIVILEGE ESCALATION

Here is the command line that simulates this attack behavior:

Command:`ryuk.exe /inject <target_process_name>`

This command injects code into a specified process to evade process-based defenses and possibly elevate privileges.

**Note:** Please ensure that you are operating in a fully authorized red team lab with permission to simulate offensive techniques.
