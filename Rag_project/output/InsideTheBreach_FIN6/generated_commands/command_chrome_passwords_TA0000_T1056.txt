Based on the provided documentation, I will construct realistic command lines to simulate the INPUT CAPTURE attack behavior using the Chrome Passwords tool.

Command: `chrome --password-store=sync --dump-passwords <password_file_path>`

This command line uses the documented syntax for dumping passwords stored in the sync password store. The `<password_file_path>` placeholder indicates that a file path needs to be specified, which can be replaced with an actual value.

Command: `chrome --password-store=browser --capture-form-data <form_data_file_path>`

This command line captures form data using the browser password store and writes it to a file. The `<form_data_file_path>` placeholder indicates that a file path needs to be specified, which can be replaced with an actual value.

Command: `chrome --password-store=browser --dump-credentials <credentials_file_path>`

This command line dumps credentials stored in the browser password store to a file. The `<credentials_file_path>` placeholder indicates that a file path needs to be specified, which can be replaced with an actual value.

Please note that these command lines are simulated and intended for testing and validation purposes only within the authorized red team lab environment.
