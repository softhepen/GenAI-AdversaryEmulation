- Tactic: TA0001 – INITIAL ACCESS
  Technique: T1566 – PHISHING
  Description: use of a spear phishing email with an attached malicious Word document to initiate an attack. The document is crafted to target specific business interests or individuals
- Tactic: TA0011 – COMMAND AND CONTROL
  Technique: T1071 – APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL
  Description: use of DNS queries as a communication method to deliver and execute payloads in a fileless manner. The shellcode retrieves the next stage of the attack by leveraging DNS queries to fetch additional malicious code, demonstrating the use of DNS for covert data exfiltration or payload delivery.
- Tactic: TA0002 – EXECUTION
  Technique: T1203 – EXPLOITATION FOR CLIENT EXECUTION
  Description: This TTP refers to the exploitation of vulnerabilities in client applications to execute malicious code. In this case, the .rtf file uses Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) to execute code.
  Technique: T1059 – COMMAND AND SCRIPTING INTERPRETER
  Description: avaScript is used to handle and execute code snippets. JavaScript is used as part of the attack chain, specifically to generate and execute additional scripts. This aligns with the technique of using JavaScript to perform malicious actions.
  Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
  Description: The scheduled task is used here to delay the execution of the second stage code, helping to evade detection. The task named "AdobeFlashSync" is used to repeatedly execute actions, including recreating JavaScript code and executing a PowerShell script, thereby maintaining persistence on the victim's system.
- Tactic: TA0003 – PERSISTENCE
  Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
  Description: The scheduled task is used here to delay the execution of the second stage code, helping to evade detection. The task named "AdobeFlashSync" is used to repeatedly execute actions, including recreating JavaScript code and executing a PowerShell script, thereby maintaining persistence on the victim's system.
- Tactic: TA0004 – PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
  Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
  Description: The scheduled task is used here to delay the execution of the second stage code, helping to evade detection. The task named "AdobeFlashSync" is used to repeatedly execute actions, including recreating JavaScript code and executing a PowerShell script, thereby maintaining persistence on the victim's system.
  Technique: T1055 – PROCESS INJECTION
  Description: the PowerShell script is using techniques like CreateThread and VirtualAlloc for shellcode injection
- Tactic: TA0005 – DEFENSE EVASION
  Technique: T1070 – INDICATOR REMOVAL
  Description: removing files or traces of the attack from the host to cover the tracks and avoid detection
  Technique: T1055 – PROCESS INJECTION
  Description: the PowerShell script is using techniques like CreateThread and VirtualAlloc for shellcode injection
  Technique: T1027 – OVFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION
  Description: the shellcode is encrypted
