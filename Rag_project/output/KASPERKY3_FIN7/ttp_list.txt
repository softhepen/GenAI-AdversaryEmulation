- Tactic: TA0002 – EXECUTION
  Technique: T1059 – COMMAND AND SCRIPTING INTERPRETER
  Description: Using PHP for management and control of attack scripts fits under the use of scripting languages for execution and control in the attack lifecycle. SQLRat uses SQL scripts to execute commands on the host system, which is an uncommon method but falls under the use of SQL as a command interpreter. Execution of malicious JavaScript code after deobfuscation. This covers the execution of scripts, particularly those that drop and execute files on a system.
  Technique: T1204 – USER EXECUTION
  Description: Victims are tricked into opening and executing the attached document, enabling the attackers to gain an initial foothold. The lure document tricks the user into executing a malicious file.
  Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
  Description: Creating scheduled task entries to maintain persistence on compromised machines. Creating scheduled task entries to maintain persistence.
- Tactic: TA0011 – COMMAND AND CONTROL
  Technique: T1105 – INGRESS TOOL TRANSFER
  Description: The panel pushing attack scripts down to compromised systems indicates transferring malicious tools or files to target systems. SQLRat retrieves and writes files to disk, which can then be executed.
  Technique: T1071 – APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL
  Description: DNSbot uses DNS to send and receive commands and data between the compromised machine and the attacker's command-and-control (C2) server. DNSbot has the ability to switch to encrypted communication channels such as HTTPS or SSL when necessary. SQLRat uses a direct SQL connection to retrieve and execute files from a remote database, indicating the use of a web-based protocol to communicate with a malicious database.
- Tactic: TA0001 – INITIAL ACCESS
  Technique: T1566 – PHISHING
  Description: Attackers send targeted emails containing malicious attachments to entice victims into opening them and executing the payload.
- Tactic: TA0005 – DEFENSE EVASION
  Technique: T1070 – INDICATOR REMOVAL
  Description: After SQL scripts are executed, the attackers' code deletes the files, leaving minimal forensic artifacts, making recovery difficult.
  Technique: T1027 – OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION
  Description: The use of obfuscation techniques to hide the true nature of malicious code.
- Tactic: TA0003 – PERSISTENCE
  Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
  Description: Creating scheduled task entries to maintain persistence on compromised machines. Creating scheduled task entries to maintain persistence.
- Tactic: TA0004 – PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
  Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
  Description: Creating scheduled task entries to maintain persistence on compromised machines. Creating scheduled task entries to maintain persistence.
