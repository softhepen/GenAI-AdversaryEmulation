I'm excited to simulate an attack using the Ryuk ransomware tool! Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will construct realistic command lines that accurately reproduce the behavior.

Here is my output:

Command: `ryuk.exe /schtasks`

This command simulates the use of task scheduling functionality to facilitate initial or recurring execution of malicious code. The `/schtasks` option allows Ryuk to create a scheduled task on the infected machine, enabling it to execute malicious code at a later time.

Please let me know if this meets your expectations!
