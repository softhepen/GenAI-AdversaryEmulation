Based on the documentation and the attack description, I've generated a command line that simulates OS credential dumping using PsExec:

Command:`psexec -i -u <Domain\User> -p <password> cmd /c "whoami"`

This command:

* Runs the `cmd` executable as an interactive process (`-i`)
* Specifies the user account `<Domain\User>` and password `<password>` for login to the remote system
* Uses the `-u` flag to specify a valid user name in the `Domain\User` syntax, which allows the process to run with access to network resources
* Copies the specified program (in this case, `cmd`) even if it already exists on the remote system (`-f` is not included)
* Runs the program so that it interacts with the desktop of the specified session on the remote system (`-i`)
* Uses the `whoami` command to obtain information about the current user

Please note that this command line does not include any specific file paths, ports, or registry keys as the attack description does not mention them.
