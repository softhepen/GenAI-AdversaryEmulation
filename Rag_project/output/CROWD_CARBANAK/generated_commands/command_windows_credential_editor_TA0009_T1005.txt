Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate a realistic command line using only the tool Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) to reproduce the attack behavior.

**Attack Description:** The malware collects basic system information and takes screenshots of victim systems.

**MITRE Technique and Tactic:** T1005 - DATA FROM LOCAL SYSTEM and TA0009 - COLLECTION

Here is the generated command line:

Command: `wce.exe /dump /ntlm`

This command uses the `/dump` option to dump the NTLM credentials stored in Windows internal memory structures, which allows us to collect basic system information.
