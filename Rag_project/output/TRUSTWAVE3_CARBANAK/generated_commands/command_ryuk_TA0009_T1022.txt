I understand that I need to generate realistic command lines using only the Ryuk tool to simulate the adversary behavior described in the attack description.

The attack description states that the adversary encrypts files and data to make them inaccessible to users and applications, potentially exfiltrating information from the victim's network. This corresponds to the MITRE technique T1022 (DATA ENCRYPTED FOR IMPACT) and tactic TA0009 (COLLECTION).

Based on the documentation provided, I will carefully analyze the attack description and identify any configuration parameters, file names, network indicators, or execution context.

Here are the command lines I generate:

Command: `ryuk.exe <file_path>`

(Note: The `<file_path>` placeholder indicates that the user should specify a valid file path for Ryuk to encrypt)

Command: `ryuk.exe --encrypt-all <directory_path>`

(Note: The `<directory_path>` placeholder indicates that the user should specify a valid directory path for Ryuk to recursively encrypt all files within it)

These command lines simulate the adversary behavior of encrypting files and data, making them inaccessible to users and applications. They also demonstrate the ability to target specific files or directories with the encryption.

I will ensure that my output meets the required format, using placeholders where needed and providing one command per line in the exact format specified.
