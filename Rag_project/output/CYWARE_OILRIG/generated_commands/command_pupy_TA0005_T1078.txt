Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool Pupy to reproduce the attack behavior described.

**Command:** `laze -s`
This command simulates credential harvesting from local system accounts using Twoface for credential harvesting. The `-s` option is used to specify the source of the credentials (in this case, local system accounts).

Please let me know if this meets the requirements or if you need further assistance!
