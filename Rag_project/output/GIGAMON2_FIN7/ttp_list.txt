- Tactic: TA0002 – EXECUTION
  Technique: T1059 – COMMAND AND SCRIPTING INTERPRETER
  Description: A custom PowerShell script is used to execute and manage payload delivery, showcasing the use of PowerShell as an execution platform. PowerShell scripts are commonly abused by attackers to execute arbitrary code and evade detection due to their presence in most Windows environments.
  Technique: T1106 – NATIVE API
  Description: The use of Windows API functions to perform the injection, manage memory, and create threads is a critical aspect of reflective DLL injection. By directly accessing low-level system calls, FIN7 ensures the payload remains hidden in memory.
- Tactic: TA0005 – DEFENSE EVASION
  Technique: T1620 – REFLECTIVE CODE LOADING
  Description: eflective DLL injection is a technique where a DLL is injected into a process without touching disk, which helps evade traditional security controls.
  Technique: T1112 – MODIFY REGISTRY
  Description: This technique involves modifying the Windows Registry to store malicious data or configurations. FIN7 uses this method to write a binary blob into the registry, which is later accessed and executed as part of their payload, making it harder to detect or remove since the data isn't stored on disk.
  Technique: T1027 – OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION
  Description: After scraping the sensitive data, the malware encrypts the stolen information before writing it to disk. This ensures that even if the files are discovered by security teams, the data remains unreadable without the decryption key. Obfuscation or encryption is a common tactic to hide stolen data from detection.
- Tactic: TA0003 – PERSISTENCE
  Technique: T1546 – EVENT TRIGGERED EXECUTION
  Description: Application Shimming is a technique that involves modifying how applications are executed on the system by creating a custom compatibility shim. In this case, FIN7 creates a shim for services.exe to ensure the malicious payload is executed whenever the service starts, achieving persistence. This is done by adding the shim to the shim database using the sdbinst.exe tool.
- Tactic: TA0004 – PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
  Technique: T1546 – EVENT TRIGGERED EXECUTION
  Description: Application Shimming is a technique that involves modifying how applications are executed on the system by creating a custom compatibility shim. In this case, FIN7 creates a shim for services.exe to ensure the malicious payload is executed whenever the service starts, achieving persistence. This is done by adding the shim to the shim database using the sdbinst.exe tool.
- Tactic: TA0007 – DISCOVERY
  Technique: T1057 – PROCESS DISCOVERY
  Description: This describes enumerating running processes on the infected system, which is a process discovery technique. The malware checks for specific processes to determine which ones it can target for scraping sensitive data.
- Tactic: TA0009 – COLLECTION
  Technique: T1005 – DATA FROM LOCAL SYSTEM
  Description: Memory scraping is a method used to extract sensitive data, such as payment card information, directly from the memory of running processes. The malware specifically targets track one and track two data, which are commonly found in credit card transactions and contain information like account numbers, expiration dates, and service codes.
