Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using **only** the tool wmic to reproduce the attack behavior of gathering information about the victim's system.

Here are the command lines:

Command:`wmic os get /value`

This command retrieves information about the operating system installed on the system.

Command:`wmic csproduct get vendor, name, version /value`

This command gathers details about the computer system, including its manufacturer (vendor), model name, and version.

Command:`wmic cpu get numberofcores, numberoflogicalprocessors, maxclockspeed /value`

This command extracts information about the processor, such as the number of physical cores, logical processors, and maximum clock speed.

Command:`wmic bios get smbiosbiosversion, releasedate /value`

This command retrieves details about the BIOS version and release date.

Command:`wmic path win32_process get processid, name, executablepath /value`

This command lists running processes on the system, including their process ID, name, and executable path.

These commands should accurately reproduce the attack behavior of gathering information about the victim's system using WMI queries.
