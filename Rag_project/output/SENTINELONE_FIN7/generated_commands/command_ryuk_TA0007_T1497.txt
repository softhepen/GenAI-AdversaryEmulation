Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will construct realistic command lines that simulate the described behavior using only the Ryuk tool.

**Command: `ryuk.exe --check-sandbox`**

This command line uses the documented option `--check-sandbox` to detect if the system environment is a sandbox (e.g., by checking the size of the drive).

**Command: `ryuk.exe --sandbox-evasion <drive_size>`**

This command line includes a placeholder `<drive_size>` for the specific value indicating the detected sandbox. The Ryuk tool will use this parameter to evade detection.

Please note that these command lines are simulated and should not be executed in a production environment without proper authorization and testing.
