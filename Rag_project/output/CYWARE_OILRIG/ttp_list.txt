- Tactic: TA0002 – EXECUTION
  Technique: T1203 – EXPLOITATION FOR CLIENT EXECUTION
  Description: Attackers embed malicious macros within Microsoft Excel files. When a victim enables macro The attackers exploit the CVE-2017-0199 vulnerability, which allows remote code execution due to improper handling of objects in memory by the Windows Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) API. The attackers exploited CVE-2017-11882, a vulnerability in Microsoft Office's Equation Editor component. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution when a specially crafted document is opened.
  Technique: T1059 – COMMAND AND SCRIPTING INTERPRETER
  Description: Attackers use PowerShell to execute malicious scripts Once the Excel document is opened and the macros are enabled, Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) scripts can be executed. PowerShell scripts are often used due to their powerful capabilities and deep integration with Windows
  Technique: T1204 – USER EXECUTION
  Description: The "Agent Injector" Trojan was used to install the ISMAgent backdoor. This indicates that once the email attachment was executed by the victim, the Trojan initiated the installation of additional malicious payloads. The emails included a variant of the "ThreeDollars" delivery document, which is used to deliver the "OopsIE" Trojan. Open a malicious document
- Tactic: TA0001 – INITIAL ACCESS
  Technique: T1566 – PHISHING
  Description: The adversaries use phishing emails to deliver weaponized Microsoft Excel documents The adversaries use phishing emails to deliver weaponized Microsoft Excel documents The attackers used spearphishing emails with the subject "Important Issue" to deliver the "Agent Injector" Trojan. The attackers used spearphishing emails, sending them to two separate email addresses within the same organization. The attackers used spearphishing emails with malicious attachments to deliver malware to the target organizations. The malware is delivered through an Excel document with malicious macros. he attackers impersonate a Cambridge University lecturer and use social networks like LinkedIn to gain the victims' trust.
  Technique: T1071 – APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL
  Description: The adversaries create and host fake websites that mimic legitimate services, such as a Juniper Networks VPN portal or University of Oxford websites.
  Technique: T1078 – VALID ACCOUNTS
  Description: Used tools like Twoface for credential harvesting from local system accounts.
- Tactic: TA0042 – RESOURCE DEVELOPMENT
  Technique: T1583 – ACQUIRE INFRASTRUCTURE
  Description: The group registers domain names similar to those of legitimate organizations (like Oxford University) to lend authenticity to their fake sites.
- Tactic: TA0003 – PERSISTENCE
  Technique: T1505 – SERVER SOFTWARE COMPONENT
  Description: The use of web shells such as TwoFace, RunningBee, and RGDoor suggests the attackers implanted malicious scripts on compromised web servers to gain persistent access.
  Technique: T1078 – VALID ACCOUNTS
  Description: Used tools like Twoface for credential harvesting from local system accounts.
- Tactic: TA0011 – COMMAND AND CONTROL
  Technique: T1071 – APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL
  Description: The RAT communicates over HTTP, allowing it to send and receive commands or exfiltrate data through standard web traffic. The RAT also uses DNS for communication, which can help evade detection by blending with regular DNS traffic.
  Technique: T1573 – ENCRYPTED CHANNEL
  Description: Created remote administration tools supporting HTTP and DNS communication with potential encryption.
- Tactic: TA0005 – DEFENSE EVASION
  Technique: T1078 – VALID ACCOUNTS
  Description: Used tools like Twoface for credential harvesting from local system accounts.
- Tactic: TA0004 – PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
  Technique: T1078 – VALID ACCOUNTS
  Description: Used tools like Twoface for credential harvesting from local system accounts.
- Tactic: TA0043 – RECONNAISSANCE
  Technique: T1589 – GATHER VICTIM IDENTITY INFORMATION
  Description: Adversaries may gather credentials that can be used during targeting.
