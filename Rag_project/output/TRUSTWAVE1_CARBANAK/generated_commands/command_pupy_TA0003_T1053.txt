Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate a realistic command line using only the pupy tool to simulate the scheduled task behavior.

Command: `pupysh.py --bg schedule_task --type at --minutes <minutes> --command "tasklist /V"`

In this command:

* `--bg` runs the command in the background as a job.
* `schedule_task` is the module used for scheduling tasks.
* `--type at` specifies that the task should be scheduled to run at a specific time (in this case, using the `at` command).
* `--minutes <minutes>` specifies the number of minutes to wait before running the task.
* `tasklist /V` is the command that will be executed when the task runs.

Note: `<minutes>` is a placeholder and should be replaced with the actual value (e.g., 30, 60, etc.).

This command simulates the scheduling of a task using the `at` command to run the `tasklist /V` command at a specific time.
