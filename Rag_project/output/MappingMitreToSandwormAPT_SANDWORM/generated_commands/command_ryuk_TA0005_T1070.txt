I've read and understood the documentation for the Ryuk ransomware tool, including its supported commands, syntax, and operational capabilities. My objective is to generate realistic command lines using only the Ryuk tool to reproduce the attack behavior described.

Based on the provided information, I understand that the goal is to simulate an adversary deleting or modifying artifacts generated within a system to remove evidence of their presence or hinder defenses, which corresponds to MITRE technique T1070 (INDICATOR REMOVAL ON HOST) and tactic TA0005 (DEFENSE EVASION).

Here are my attempts to generate realistic command lines using only the Ryuk tool:

Command: `ryuk.exe --delete-backups`

This command simulates an adversary deleting backups on the infected machine, which is a key step in evading defenses.

Command: `ryuk.exe --stop-services`

This command stops services running on the infected machine, further hindering defenses and attempting to prevent recovery of sensitive data.

Command: `ryuk.exe --mount-shares`

This command mounts discoverable shares on the infected machine, allowing an adversary to access and potentially exfiltrate sensitive data.

Please let me know if these command lines accurately reproduce the attack behavior described.
