Based on the provided documentation and the objective to simulate reflective DLL injection using PsExec, I will construct realistic command lines that accurately reproduce the attack behavior.

Here is the output:

Command: `psexec \\target_machine -accepteula -nobanner -l -priority high cmd /c start /b "path_to_dll" /a /w`

Note:
*   `\\target_machine` is the target machine to which PsExec will connect and execute the command.
*   `-accepteula` and `-nobanner` flags suppress the display of the license dialog and startup banner, respectively.
*   `-l` flag runs the process as a limited user (strips the Administrators group and allows only privileges assigned to the Users group).
*   `-priority high` flag sets the priority of the process to high.
*   `cmd /c start /b "path_to_dll" /a /w` executes the command to inject the DLL into a process.

Please note that I have used placeholders for `target_machine`, `path_to_dll`. These values should be replaced with actual parameters during execution.
