Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the PAExec tool to simulate retrieving domain membership information, which is part of network configuration discovery.

Here are my outputs:

Command: `PAExec \\* -s ipconfig /all`

This command uses the `-s` option to run as the System account and executes the `ipconfig /all` command on all computers in the current domain, allowing for the retrieval of domain membership information.

Command: `PAExec @computers.txt -u <domain_admin> -p <password> -i -c ipconfig /all`

This command uses the `@file` option to execute the command on each computer listed in the `computers.txt` file. It also specifies a username and password for login, allowing for execution of the command as a domain admin user.

Command: `PAExec \\* -s net group "Domain Admins" /domain`

This command uses the `-s` option to run as the System account and executes the `net group "Domain Admins" /domain` command on all computers in the current domain, retrieving information about the Domain Admins group.

Note: I have used placeholders for `<domain_admin>`, `<password>`, and `<computers.txt>` as required by the policy.
