Based on the documentation provided, I will generate realistic command lines using only the PAExec tool to reproduce the attack behavior of network service discovery.

Here is the output:

Command: `paexec -n 30 -u <username> -p <password> //remote_host cmd /c "net view"`
Command: `paexec -s -u <username> -p <password> \\remote_host "services.msc"`
Command: `paexec -n 30 -u <username> -p <password> //remote_host "wmic /node:<remote_host> path win32_service get name, state"`

Note:

* I used placeholders for the username, password, and remote host, as required by the output format.
* The first command uses the `-n` option to specify a timeout of 30 seconds, and the `-u` and `-p` options to specify the username and password. It then runs the `net view` command on the remote host using the Windows cmd shell.
* The second command uses the `-s` option to run the PAExec process in the System account, and the `-u` and `-p` options to specify the username and password. It then runs the built-in `services.msc` command on the remote host to list running services.
* The third command is similar to the first two, but uses the `-n` option to specify a timeout of 30 seconds, and the `wmic` command with the `/node` parameter to query the remote host's win32_service class.

Please note that these commands are designed to simulate network service discovery attacks using the PAExec tool.
