Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate a realistic command line using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the specified behavior.

Here is my attempt:

Command: `chrome-passwords -c`

This command uses the option `-c` to show both passwords and cookies in a format similar to what was described.
