Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate a realistic command line using only the tool PsExec to simulate the attack behavior.

Command: `psexec.exe -accepteula -nobanner -i -e <file_path>`

This command uses the documented syntax for PsExec, specifying the following options:

* `-accepteula` and `-nobanner`: suppresses the display of the license dialog and startup banner
* `-i`: runs the program so that it interacts with the desktop of the specified session on the remote system (required for interactive execution)
* `-e`: does not load the specified account's profile
* `<file_path>`: placeholder for the file path to be executed

This command line simulates the behavior of executing a script or binary using PsExec, which corresponds to the MITRE technique and tactic identified in the attack description.
