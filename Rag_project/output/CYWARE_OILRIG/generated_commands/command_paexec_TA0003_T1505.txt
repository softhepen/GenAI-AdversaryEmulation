Based on the attack description, I understand that the attackers implanted malicious scripts on compromised web servers to gain persistent access.

To simulate this behavior using PAExec, I will carefully analyze the attack description and identify any configuration parameters, file names, network indicators, or execution context. Then, I will construct realistic command lines that accurately reproduce the attack behavior using only the tool's documented syntax and capabilities.

Here is my output:

Command: `paexec -i -c <web_server_script_name>.bat`

Note: `<web_server_script_name>` should be replaced with a placeholder indicating the actual file name of the malicious script on the compromised web server.
