Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the extraction of credentials from password repositories.

Here are the command lines:
```
Command: `chrome-passwords -p`
```

This command line uses the `-p` option, which is documented as extracting locally saved passwords and cookies (with decryption) on Google Chrome.
