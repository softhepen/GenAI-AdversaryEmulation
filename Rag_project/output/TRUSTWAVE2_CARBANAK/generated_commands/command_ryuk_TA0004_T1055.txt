Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the Ryuk tool to reproduce the PROCESS INJECTION technique.

**Command:** `ryuk.exe <inject_code_into_process>`

The Ryuk executable requires admin privileges on the machine to properly modify its SE_TOKENS, perform the injection, and encrypt the contents of the host. The `<inject_code_into_process>` placeholder represents the process into which code will be injected.

Since PROCESS INJECTION is a technique used for persistence and evasion, I will use the following command line:

`Command: `ryuk.exe --inject-code-into-process=<target_process_name>`

Please note that `<target_process_name>` should be replaced with an actual process name on the target machine.
