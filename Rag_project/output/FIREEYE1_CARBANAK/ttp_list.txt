- Tactic: TA0005 – DEFENSE EVASION
  Technique: T1027 – OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION
  Description: The commands and parameter names are hashed before being compared by the binary, making it difficult to recover the original names of commands and parameters. Use of Base64 encoding to replace specific characters ('/' and '+') with others ('.' and '-') Described when the encoded payload is made to resemble a URI by inserting a random number of '/' characters in random locations. This is used to disguise the payload as a normal URI. This technique involves making analysis more difficult by encoding or encrypting data and/or commands. It can be used to protect strings, file names, command-and-control (C2) server addresses, and other variables used by the malware.
