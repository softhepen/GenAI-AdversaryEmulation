Based on the attack description and the tool documentation, I will construct realistic command lines that simulate the behavior of obfuscating files or information to evade detection.

Here is my output:

Command: `Invoke-PSImage -Script { Get-Content -Path <file_path> -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue }`

This command encodes a PowerShell script in the pixels of a PNG file, which can be used to evade detection by hiding the script's contents. The `<file_path>` placeholder indicates that I need to specify a file path for the actual execution.

Let me know if this meets your requirements!
