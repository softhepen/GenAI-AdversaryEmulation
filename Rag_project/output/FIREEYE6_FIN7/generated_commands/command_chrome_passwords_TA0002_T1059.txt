Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the described behavior.

Here is my output:

Command: `chrome-passwords -c`

This command uses the "-c" option to show cookies as specified in the documentation. This simulates the use of VBScript and mshta.exe to demonstrate scripting for malicious purposes, which corresponds to the TTP "COMMAND AND SCRIPTING INTERPRETER".

Please let me know if this meets your requirements or if you need further assistance!
