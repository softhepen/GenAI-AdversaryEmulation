Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using the Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) tool to reproduce the attack behavior.

**Command:** `wce -l`

This command lists current logon sessions. According to the attack description, adversaries may abuse various implementations of JavaScript for execution. To simulate this behavior, I'll use WCE to list active logon sessions, which could potentially be exploited.

**Command:** `wce -l -v`

This command lists current logon sessions with verbose output enabled. This can provide additional information about the active logon sessions, such as session IDs and user accounts.

Next, I'll use WCE to attempt to inject JavaScript code into an execution context. According to the documentation, WCE has the capability to automatically switch to code injection when the first method cannot be performed. I'll use this feature to simulate the attack behavior.

**Command:** `wce -i <javascript_code>`

This command injects the specified JavaScript code into an execution context. To reproduce the attack behavior, I'll insert a placeholder for the JavaScript code: `<javascript_code>`.

Here is the complete output:

Command: `wce -l`
Command: `wce -l -v`
Command: `wce -i <javascript_code>`
