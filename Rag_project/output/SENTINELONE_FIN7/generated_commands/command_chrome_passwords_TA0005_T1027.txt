Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using the **chrome-passwords** tool to simulate the obfuscated JavaScript backdoor behavior.

Here is my output:

Command: `chrome-passwords -p <local_app_chrome_directory>\User Data\Default\Cookies.db`

This command extracts locally saved cookies (with decryption) from Google Chrome, which could potentially be used to store and execute malicious code.

Command: `chrome-passwords -p <local_app_chrome_directory>\User Data\Default\Login Data.sqlitedb`

This command recovers and decrypts locally saved passwords (with the help of Windows Crypt API functions) stored in the SQLLite3 DB file, which could be used to gain unauthorized access to sensitive areas.

Command: `chrome-passwords -p <local_app_chrome_directory>\User Data\Default\Local Storage.sqlitedb`

This command extracts and decrypts locally saved data (e.g., web storage, application cache) from Google Chrome, which could contain malicious code or data.

Please note that these commands are designed to simulate the attack behavior described in the MITRE technique and tactic, and should not be executed outside of a fully authorized red team lab environment.
