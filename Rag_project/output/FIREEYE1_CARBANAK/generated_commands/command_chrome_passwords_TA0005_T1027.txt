Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the behavior.

Here is the output:

Command: `chrome-passwords -c`

This command uses the `-c` flag to show cookies in addition to passwords. The output will include the host key, path, and cookie value.

Please note that I have not included any specific values or file paths as they were not explicitly specified in the attack description.
