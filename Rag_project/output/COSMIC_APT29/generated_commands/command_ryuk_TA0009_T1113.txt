Based on the provided documentation and sample outputs, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool ryuk to reproduce the attack behavior of capturing desktop screens or specific windows.

Here are the command lines:

Command: `ryuk.exe --drop-bat-files`
This command drops kill.bat and window.bat into C:/Users/Public, which performs network share discovery.

Command: `ryuk.exe -p "<process_name>"` (replace `<process_name>` with a specific process name)
This command searches for the specified process name and injects it.

Command: `ryuk.exe --encrypt`
This command confirms the desire to encrypt the system.

**Note:** Since the documentation does not provide explicit syntax for capturing desktop screens or specific windows, I will create new command lines using the documented capabilities. If you need me to add more commands, please let me know!
