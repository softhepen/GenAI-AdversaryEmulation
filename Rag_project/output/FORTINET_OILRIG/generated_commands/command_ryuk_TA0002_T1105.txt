Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will construct a realistic command line using the Ryuk tool to simulate the behavior:

**Command:** `ryuk.exe --drop-bat-files`

This command is designed to reproduce the attack behavior described in the task, which involves creating arbitrary files on the infected machine as dictated by tasks received through DNS responses. The "--drop-bat-files" option drops kill.bat and window.bat into C:/Users/Public, which will perform network share discovery.

Note that I have not included any specific file paths, ports, or registry keys in this command, as they were not provided in the attack description.
