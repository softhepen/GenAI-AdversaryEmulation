I will carefully analyze the attack description and use the Ryuk tool's documented syntax and capabilities to construct realistic command lines that simulate the described behavior.

Here is my output:

Command: `ryuk.exe /capture-desktop`

This command captures a screenshot of the victim's desktop, as per the requirement in the attack description.
