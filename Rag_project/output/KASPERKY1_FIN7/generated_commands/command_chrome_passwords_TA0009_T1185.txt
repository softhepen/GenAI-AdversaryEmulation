Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using the chrome-passwords tool to simulate the behavior of a JS sniffer (MageCarting) attack.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -p > output.txt`

This command recovers locally saved passwords for Google Chrome without waiting for random input at the end. The `-p` flag disables the waiting mechanism, allowing us to forward the output to a file named `output.txt`.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -c > cookies_output.txt`

This command shows both saved passwords and cookies for Google Chrome, as specified in the documentation. The `-c` flag enables the display of cookies.

Next, I will use the chrome-passwords tool to extract the decrypted password and cookie values from the local database file.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -p > output.txt`
**Output:**
```
http://example.com
username
password123
```

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -c > cookies_output.txt`
**Output:**
```
host_key    path    cookie_value
example.com  /login   session_id=ABC123; expires=Tue, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT;
```

These command lines simulate the behavior of a JS sniffer (MageCarting) attack by extracting and displaying saved passwords and cookies from the local Chrome database.

Please note that these commands are generated using only the documented syntax and capabilities of the chrome-passwords tool, without any additional functionality or modifications.
