Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool wmic to reproduce the SYSTEM INFORMATION DISCOVERY attack behavior.

Here are the command lines:
```
Command: `wmic os get /value`
Command: `wmic cpu get /value`
Command: `wmic bios get /value`
Command: `wmic process list /output:XML > process_output.xml`
Command: `wmic path win32_process get name,processid,caption /format:value`
```
These command lines use the documented syntax and capabilities of wmic to retrieve system information such as OS, CPU, BIOS, and running processes.
