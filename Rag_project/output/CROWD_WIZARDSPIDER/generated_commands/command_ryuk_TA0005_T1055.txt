Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool Ryuk to reproduce the process injection behavior.

Here is my output:

Command: `ryuk.exe --process-name <target_process_name>`

This command line injects code into a target process named `<target_process_name>` and performs process injection.

Note: The `<target_process_name>` placeholder should be replaced with an actual process name of interest, such as "explorer.exe" or "chrome.exe".

Please let me know if this meets the required output format and if I need to make any adjustments.
