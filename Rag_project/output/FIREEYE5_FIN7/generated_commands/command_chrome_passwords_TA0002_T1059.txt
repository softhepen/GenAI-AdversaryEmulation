Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the described behavior.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords.exe -c > shim_database_file.sdb`

This command uses the `-c` option to show cookies in addition to passwords, and redirects the output to a file named `shim_database_file.sdb`, which is part of the persistence mechanism.

Please note that I have used placeholders where needed and followed the exact format required for the output.
