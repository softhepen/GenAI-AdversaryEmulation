Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using the **chrome-passwords** tool to simulate the described behavior.

Here are the command lines that reproduce the attack:

Command: `chrome-passwords -p <stolen_credentials>`

Note: `<stolen_credentials>` should be replaced with the actual stolen credentials obtained from tools like Mimikatz, LaZagne, and Kerbrute.
