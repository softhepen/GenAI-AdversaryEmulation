I'll generate realistic command lines using only the Ryuk tool to reproduce the attack behavior.

Here is my output:

Command: `ryuk.exe --inject-lockergoga`

This command injects LockerGoga ransomware, which is a key component of this attack.

Next step:
Command: `ryuk.exe --mount-discoverable-shares --stop-services --delete-backups --encrypt-files`
