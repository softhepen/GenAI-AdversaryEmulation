Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool psexec to reproduce the APT34 campaign's persistence mechanism.

Command: `psexec \\<remote_system> cmd /c "Client update.exe"`



The command above simulates the execution of the dropped executable file ("Client update.exe") on a remote system, which is part of the persistence mechanism used by the APT34 campaign. The `-c` flag copies the specified executable to the remote system for execution.

Note: The `<remote_system>` placeholder should be replaced with the actual target system name or IP address.
