  Technique: T1190 – EXPLOIT PUBLIC-FACING APPLICATION
  Description: The initial compromise was achieved through the exploitation of a known vulnerability, CVE-2017-0199, which allows remote code execution through a specially crafted file.
  Technique: T1566 – PHISHING
  Description: APT34 sent a malicious file as an attachment in a spear-phishing email to the victim organization. This attachment is specifically crafted to exploit a vulnerability once opened by the target, leading to the execution of the malware payload.
- Tactic: TA0005 – DEFENSE EVASION
  Technique: T1211 – EXPLOITATION FOR DEFENSE EVASION
  Description: By overwriting the function address with an existing instruction from EQNEDT32.EXE, the malware avoids detection by leveraging legitimate system functions to execute its payload, thus evading security defenses. By overwriting the function address with an existing instruction from EQNEDT32.EXE, the malware avoids detection by leveraging legitimate system functions to execute its payload, thus evading security defenses.
  Technique: T1218 – SYSTEM BINARY PROXY EXECUTION
  Description: Adversaries may bypass process and/or signature-based defenses by proxying execution of malicious content with signed, or otherwise trusted, binaries.
  Technique: T1140 – DEOBFUSCATE/DECODE FILES OR INFORMATION
  Description: The use of Ce%Util.exe to decode base64-encoded files (hUpdateCheckers.base and dUpdateCheckers.base) fits this technique. It's an example of how attackers use legitimate tools to handle encoded data, revealing the actual payload.
  Technique: T1027 – OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION
  Description: Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit.
  Technique: T1036 – MASQUERADING
  Description: Using legitimate-looking filenames.
  Technique: T1070 – INDICATOR REMOVAL
  Description: After executing, cUpdateCheckers.bat and the *.base files are deleted from the staging directory to remove traces of the malware's presence and reduce detection risk.
- Tactic: TA0003 – PERSISTENCE
  Technique: T1543 – CREATE OR MODIFY SYSTEM PROCESS
