Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate a realistic command line using Plink to simulate the INGRESS TOOL TRANSFER technique (T1105) and reproduce the behavior of downloading and executing a reverse shell on the compromised host.

Here is the generated command:

Command: `plink.exe -i <private_key_file> -ssh user@192.168.0.4 -m "<command_to_execute>"`

Explanation:

* `-i` option specifies the private key file for user authentication.
* `user` is the attacker's username on the compromised host.
* `192.168.0.4` is the IP address of the compromised host.
* `-m` option allows reading remote commands from a file, which will contain the command to execute the reverse shell.

Please note that I have used placeholders (`<private_key_file>` and `<command_to_execute>`) for parameters that are not explicitly specified in the attack description. These placeholders should be replaced with actual values when executing the command.

I hope this generated command meets your requirements.
