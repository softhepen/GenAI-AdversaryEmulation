Based on the provided documentation and objective, I will generate realistic command lines using the tool "chrome-passwords" to reproduce the attack behavior.

Here is the output:

Command: `chrome-passwords`
Command: `chrome-passwords -c`
Command: `chrome-passwords -p`

These command lines aim to access stored credentials by listing saved passwords and cookies without any additional arguments, with the option to display cookies (-c) or disable waiting for random input at the end (-p).
