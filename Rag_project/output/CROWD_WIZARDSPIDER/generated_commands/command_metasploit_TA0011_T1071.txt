Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines to simulate the establishment of command and control communication with a remote IP.

Here is the output:

Command: `use scanner/winrm/winrm_login`

Command: `run http://user:<pass>@<remote_IP>:5985`

Please note that you need to replace `<remote_IP>` with the actual IP address of the target system, and `<pass>` with the valid credentials (if available).
