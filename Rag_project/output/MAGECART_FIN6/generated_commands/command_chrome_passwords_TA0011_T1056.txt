Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the input capture attack behavior.

Here is the output:

Command: `chrome-passwords`

This command displays saved passwords without any argument, as specified in the documentation. The output will show URL, username, and password for each saved credential.

Command: `chrome-passwords -p > output.txt`

This command disables waiting for random input at the end, allowing us to forward the output to a file like chrome-passwords.exe -p > output.txt.

Command: `chrome-passwords -c`

This command shows cookies in addition to passwords, as specified by the -c option. The output will show host_key, path, and cookie value for each saved cookie.

Please note that I have not included any specific parameters or file names, as they were not explicitly mentioned in the attack description.
