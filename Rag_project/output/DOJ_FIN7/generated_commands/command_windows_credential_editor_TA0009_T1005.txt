Based on the provided documentation and objective, I will generate realistic command lines using only the Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) tool to reproduce the FIN7 attack behavior.

**Command:** `wce -n MYDOMAIN -u NETWORK SERVICE -p WORKGROUP`

This command aims to dump Kerberos tickets stored in the system memory, including the TGT. The `-n` option specifies the domain name, `-u` option specifies the username, and `-p` option specifies the password.

**Command:** `wce -k MYDOMAIN -t <TGT_ticket> -s <Session_Key>`

This command attempts to reuse the obtained Kerberos ticket (TGT) on another Windows machine. The `<TGT_ticket>` placeholder represents the actual TGT ticket, and `<Session_Key>` is a placeholder for the session key.

**Command:** `wce -d MYDOMAIN -u NETWORK SERVICE -p WORKGROUP`

This command attempts to obtain cleartext passwords stored by the Windows Digest Authentication security package. The `-d` option specifies the domain name, `-u` option specifies the username, and `-p` option specifies the password.

Please note that these commands are simulated and intended for testing purposes only in a controlled lab environment.
