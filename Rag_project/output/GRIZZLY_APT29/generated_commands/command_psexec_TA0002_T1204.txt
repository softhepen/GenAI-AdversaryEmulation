Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using **only** the tool psexec to reproduce the attack behavior.

Here is the output:

Command: `psexec -l <user_name> <target_system>`

Please note that I have used placeholders for `<user_name>` and `<target_system>` as they are not specified in the attack description. You must replace these with actual values.

This command line simulates the execution of a process on the target system with limited privileges, which is consistent with the attack behavior described (T1204: USER EXECUTION).
