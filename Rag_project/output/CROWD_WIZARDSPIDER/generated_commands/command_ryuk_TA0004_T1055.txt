I understand the task and will generate realistic command lines using only the Ryuk tool to reproduce the described attack behavior.

Based on the documentation, I identify that the attack corresponds to T1055 (PROCESS INJECTION) and TA0004 (PRIVILEGE ESCALATION). The description mentions process injection methods to execute code within the context of a target process. 

Here are the command lines that simulate this attack:

Command: `ryuk.exe -p <process_name>`

Where `<process_name>` is the name of the process to search and perform process injection (case sensitive).

Note: I will make sure to follow the guidelines and provide the output in the required format, using placeholders where needed.
