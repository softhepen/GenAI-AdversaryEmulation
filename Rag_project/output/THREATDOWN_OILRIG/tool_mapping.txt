Based on the provided internal tools and technique descriptions, I analyzed each technique and determined whether any internal tool explicitly confirms it can reproduce or simulate the behavior described. Here is the output:

- Tactic: TA0001 – INITIAL ACCESS
Technique: T1566 – PHISHING
Description: The malicious email targeting a government official from Jordan's foreign ministry, which contained a malicious Excel document, is a clear example of spear-phishing with an attachment.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1204 – USER EXECUTION
Description: The Excel attachment contains a macro that performs malicious activities.
Tool: chrome-passwords

- Tactic: TA0002 – EXECUTION
Technique: T1203 – EXPLOITATION FOR CLIENT EXECUTION
Description: The image in the document is a social engineering tactic designed to persuade the victim to enable the macro, which is crucial for the attack to proceed.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
Description: The creation of a `TaskService` object and retrieving the task folder that contains the list of current tasks indicates that the malware is interacting with the Windows Task Scheduler. This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to establish persistence or perform automated tasks.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0005 – DEFENSE EVASION
Technique: T1564 – HIDE ARTIFACTS
Description: After the macro is enabled, the image is replaced with the coat of arms of the Jordanian government. This act of swapping images can be seen as a form of masquerading, where the attacker attempts to make the document appear more legitimate to avoid raising suspicion from the victim.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1497 – VIRTUALIZATION/SANDBOX EVASION
Description: The malware checks if a mouse is connected, which suggests it's attempting to determine if it is running on a real machine rather than in a virtualized or sandbox environment. This helps the malware avoid execution in an analysis environment, thus impairing defenses.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1027 – OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION
Description: he malware reads base64-encoded content from the user forms, decodes it, and writes the decoded content into the created files. The use of compression to obscure the data being transmitted is an example of data obfuscation.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0011 – COMMAND AND CONTROL
Technique: T1071 – APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL
Description: Adversaries use DNS for communication between the malware and its C2 server. This technique involves using DNS (Domain Name System) for C2 communications.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1105 – INGRESS TOOL TRANSFER
Description: This technique involves the transfer of files or tools into a compromised environment, often from a remote server.
Tool: Ryuk

- Tactic: TA0007 – DISCOVERY
Technique: T1082 – SYSTEM INFORMATION DISCOVERY
Description: Uses WMI query to get IP address information.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1497 – VIRTUALIZATION/SANDBOX EVASION
Description: The malware checks if a mouse is connected, which suggests it's attempting to determine if it is running on a real machine rather than in a virtualized or sandbox environment. This helps the malware avoid execution in an analysis environment, thus impairing defenses.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0003 – PERSISTENCE
Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
Description: The creation of a `TaskService` object and retrieving the task folder that contains the list of current tasks indicates that the malware is interacting with the Windows Task Scheduler. This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to establish persistence or perform automated tasks.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1547 – BOOT OR LOGON AUTOSTART EXECUTION
Description: This technique involves using the Windows Registry or startup folder to ensure that malicious executables are run at system startup or user logon.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0004 – PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
Description: The creation of a `TaskService` object and retrieving the task folder that contains the list of current tasks indicates that the malware is interacting with the Windows Task Scheduler. This technique involves creating or modifying scheduled tasks or jobs to establish persistence or perform automated tasks.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1547 – BOOT OR LOGON AUTOSTART EXECUTION
Description: This technique involves using the Windows Registry or startup folder to ensure that malicious executables are run at system startup or user logon.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0010 – EXFILTRATION
Technique: T1041 – EXFILTRATION OVER C2 CHANNEL
Description: Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an existing command and control channel.
Tool: No tool
