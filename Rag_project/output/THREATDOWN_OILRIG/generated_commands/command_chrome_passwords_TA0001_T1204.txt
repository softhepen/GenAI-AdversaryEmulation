Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the attack behavior.

Here are the command lines that simulate the described behavior:

Command: `chrome-passwords -p`
This command disables waiting for random input at the end and allows us to forward the output to a file or another process.

Command: `chrome-passwords -c`
This command shows both passwords and cookies, which can be useful in simulating the attack behavior.

Command: `chrome-passwords -p > output.txt`
This command saves the output of chrome-passwords to a file named "output.txt" without waiting for random input at the end.
