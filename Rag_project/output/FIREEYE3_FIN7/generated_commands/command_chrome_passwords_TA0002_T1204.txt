Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the following attack behavior:

**Command:** `chrome-passwords`

The goal is to convince the user to enable macros for execution through social engineering tactics. To simulate this behavior, we need to use the -p flag to disable waiting for random input at the end and display saved passwords as well as cookies.

Here's a possible command line:
```
Command: `chrome-passwords -p`
```
This command will display saved passwords and cookies without requiring any additional input. The output will be in the format specified in the documentation, with each password or cookie on a new line.

Note that this command does not require any elevated privileges, as mentioned in the documentation.
