Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the attack behavior.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords`
**Objective:** Extract locally saved passwords and cookies from Google Chrome.

**Attack Behavior:** The backdoor is implemented using JavaScript, executed via the Windows Script Host (wscript.exe).

Here's a possible command line:

Command: `chrome-passwords -c`

This command uses the `-c` option to show both passwords and cookies. Since there is no specific file or path mentioned in the attack description, I will use the default behavior of chrome-passwords, which extracts data from the default SQLite database file.

Please note that this command may not be the actual command used by the attacker, but it simulates the extraction of locally saved passwords and cookies using chrome-passwords.
