Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the behavior of adversaries capturing user keystrokes to intercept credentials.

Here is the output:

Command: `chrome-passwords`
Command: `chrome-passwords -p`
Command: `chrome-passwords -c`

The first command simply runs the tool without any arguments, displaying saved passwords and cookies as specified in the documentation.

The second command uses the `-p` flag to disable waiting for random input at the end, allowing us to forward the output to a file or pipe it into another command. This simulates an adversary capturing credentials quickly and quietly.

The third command uses the `-c` flag to show both passwords and cookies, as specified in the documentation.

These command lines accurately reproduce the attack behavior of adversaries intercepting user keystrokes to capture credentials.
