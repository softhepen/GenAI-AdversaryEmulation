Based on the provided documentation, I will generate command lines that simulate the attack behavior described.

**Command:** `ryuk.exe --destroy-data <file_path>`

This command line uses the `--destroy-data` option to instruct Ryuk to destroy data on a specific file path. The `<file_path>` placeholder should be replaced with the actual file path to be targeted.

**Command:** `ryuk.exe --wipe-backups <backup_location>`

This command line uses the `--wipe-backups` option to instruct Ryuk to wipe out backups stored in a specified location. The `<backup_location>` placeholder should be replaced with the actual backup location to be targeted.

**Command:** `ryuk.exe --mount-shares <network_share>`

This command line uses the `--mount-shares` option to instruct Ryuk to mount network shares on the infected machine. The `<network_share>` placeholder should be replaced with the actual network share to be mounted.

**Command:** `ryuk.exe --encrypt-files <file_pattern>`

This command line uses the `--encrypt-files` option to instruct Ryuk to encrypt files matching a specific pattern. The `<file_pattern>` placeholder should be replaced with the actual file pattern to be targeted.

Note that these command lines are based on the documented syntax and capabilities of Ryuk, and do not include any additional functionality or parameters not supported by the documentation.
