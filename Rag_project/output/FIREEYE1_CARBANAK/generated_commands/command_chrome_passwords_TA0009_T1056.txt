Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the capture of keystrokes behavior.

Here is my output:

Command: `chrome-passwords`

The documentation suggests that the tool can be used without any arguments to display saved passwords. However, since we are looking to simulate the capture of keystrokes behavior, I will use the `-c` option to show cookies as well.

Command: `chrome-passwords -c`

According to the attack description, the goal is to log key strokes for configured processes and send them to a command and control (C2) server. To achieve this, I will assume that the tool chrome-passwords can be used to capture keystrokes by running it with the `-p` option.

Command: `chrome-passwords -p`

Please note that the documentation does not provide explicit examples of how to use the tool for capturing keystrokes. Therefore, I have composed a new command line using the supported syntax and capabilities of the tool.

Let me know if this output meets your requirements.
