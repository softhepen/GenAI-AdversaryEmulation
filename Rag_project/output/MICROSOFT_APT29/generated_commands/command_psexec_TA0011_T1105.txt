Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the PsExec tool to simulate the described behavior.

Here is the output:

Command: `psexec \\<target_computer> -s -nobanner -accepteula -c <file_path>\cyzfc.dat`

In this command line, I used the following parameters:
* `-s` runs the process as system
* `-nobanner` suppresses the startup banner and copyright message
* `-accepteula` suppresses the display of the license dialog
* `-c` copies the specified executable to the remote system for execution

Note that `<target_computer>` should be replaced with the actual target computer name or IP address, and `<file_path>` should be replaced with the absolute path where the `cyzfc.dat` file is located on the target system.

Please let me know if you need any modifications or additional output.
