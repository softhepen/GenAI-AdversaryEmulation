Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) tool to reproduce the attack behavior.

**Attack Behavior:** Users execute malicious files, such as documents with macros that download additional malicious payloads. This corresponds to Technique ID: T1204 (USER EXECUTION) and Tactic ID: TA0002 (EXECUTION).

Here are the generated command lines:
```
Command: `wce.exe -dump-kerb`
```
This command dumps Kerberos tickets, including the TGT, stored in Windows machines.

**Next Step:** Reuse/Load those tickets on another Windows machine to authenticate to other systems and services.

```
Command: `wce.exe -load-kerb <ticket_file>`
```
Replace `<ticket_file>` with the actual path to the dumped Kerberos ticket file.

**Additional Step:** Use the loaded Kerberos ticket to access other systems and services, potentially allowing execution of malicious payloads.

Please note that these command lines only simulate a part of the attack behavior. In reality, additional steps would be required to fully execute the attack.
