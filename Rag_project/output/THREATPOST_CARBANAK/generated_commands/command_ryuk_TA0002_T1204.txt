Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the Ryuk tool to reproduce the specified behavior.

The attack description states that if the attachments are executed, the malware is activated. This corresponds to the MITRE technique T1204 (USER EXECUTION) and tactic TA0002 (EXECUTION).

Here's a possible command line:
```
Command: `ryuk.exe -e --drop-bat-files`
```
This command line uses the `--drop-bat-files` option, which drops kill.bat and window.bat into C:/Users/Public, allowing for network share discovery. The `-e` option confirms that the user wants to encrypt the system.

Please note that I've only used the Ryuk tool's documented syntax and capabilities to construct this command line.
