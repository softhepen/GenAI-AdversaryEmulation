Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate a realistic command line using the Ryuk tool to reproduce the behavior of storing an instance of the GRIFFON implant in the registry.

**Command:** `ryuk.exe --process-name <process_name> -e`

In this command:

* `--process-name` specifies the process name where the GRIFFON implant will be injected ( placeholder for a specific process name).
* `-e` confirms that you want to encrypt the system.

Please note that I've only used the documented syntax and capabilities of the Ryuk tool, without inventing any new functionality.
