Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool Ryuk to reproduce the specified attack behavior.

Here is my output:

Command: `ryuk.exe --inject <dll_name> --process <target_process>`



This command simulates the reflective DLL injection method of process injection, as described in the MITRE technique T1055. The `<dll_name>` and `<target_process>` placeholders need to be replaced with specific values.

Please note that I have carefully analyzed the attack description and constructed a realistic command line using the tool's documented syntax and capabilities.
