Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the ENCRYPTED CHANNEL technique.

Here are the command lines:

Command:`chrome-passwords -p <url> -u <username> -c <blob_column_name>`

This command is used to extract locally saved passwords and cookies from Google Chrome, decrypt them, and store the decrypted data in a blob column.

Command:`chrome-passwords -e <seed_local_to_user> -d <encrypted_data> -o <output_file>`

This command uses Windows Crypt API functions (CryptProtectData) to encrypt data using a user-specific seed. The output file will contain the encrypted data.

Command:`chrome-passwords -d <encrypted_data> -s <seed_local_to_user> -o <output_file>`

This command decrypts the previously encrypted data using the same user-specific seed.

Please note that these command lines are generated based on the provided documentation and attack description, without any additional information or modifications.
