Based on the provided documentation and requirements, I will generate realistic command lines using only the WMIC tool to simulate the attack behavior.

Here is my output:

Command: `wmic csproduct get uuid`

Command: `wmic os get osarchitecture`

Command: `wmic cpu get processorid`

Command: `wmic diskdrive get model, size`

Command: `wmic logicaldisk get volumeSerialNumber`

Command: `wmic process call create "notepad.exe"`

Please note that I have used placeholders where necessary and followed the exact output format as specified.
