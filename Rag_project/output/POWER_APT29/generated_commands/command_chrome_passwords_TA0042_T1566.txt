Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using **only** the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the targeted phishing attack behavior.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -p`
This command extracts locally saved passwords and cookies from Google Chrome, simulating the behavior of an attacker exploiting the encryption mechanism.

Note: The `-p` flag is used to specify the extraction of passwords and cookies.

Since the documentation does not provide specific parameters for this command, I will leave them as placeholders:

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -p <file_path> <url> <username>`

Please let me know if you need further assistance or if there's anything else I can help with!
