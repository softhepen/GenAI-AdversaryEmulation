Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate a command line that simulates the described behavior using the chrome-passwords tool.

Command:`chrome-passwords -p`

This command uses the `-p` flag to disable waiting for random input at the end, allowing me to forward the output to a file or another process.
