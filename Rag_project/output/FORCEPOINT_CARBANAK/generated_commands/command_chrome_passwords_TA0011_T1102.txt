Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate a realistic command line using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the attack behavior.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -c`

This command is designed to extract locally saved passwords and cookies from Google Chrome, with the option to decrypt them. The `-c` flag specifically requests to show cookies in addition to passwords.

Please note that I have not included any specific file paths, ports, or registry keys as they are not explicitly mentioned in the attack description.
