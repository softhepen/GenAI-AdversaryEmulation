Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the PsExec tool to simulate the initial phase of the intrusion, which corresponds to the T1078 technique (VALID ACCOUNTS) in TA0001 (INITIAL ACCESS).

Here is the output:

Command: `psexec -i \\<remote_system> -u <attacker_username> -p <attacker_password>`
