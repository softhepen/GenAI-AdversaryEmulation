Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the UNSECURED CREDENTIALS technique (T1552).

Here are the command lines:

Command: `chrome-passwords -p`
Command: `chrome-passwords <file_path>`
Command: `chrome-passwords --<dll_name>`

Note that I have not included any specific parameters or values in these command lines, as they were not provided in the attack description. If additional information becomes available, I will be happy to modify these command lines accordingly.

Please let me know if this meets your requirements!
