Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the attack behavior.

**Obfuscation of traffic and data**

Command:`chrome-passwords -p`

This command enables obfuscation by encrypting the output with the user's specific credentials, making it difficult to distinguish between legitimate and malicious traffic.

**PowerShell code encryption and encoding in base64**

Command:`chrome-passwords <powershell_script> | base64`

This command uses the chrome-passwords tool to encrypt the PowerShell script using the user's specific credentials. The output is then piped to the base64 encoding tool, making it difficult to identify the encoded script.

**Decryption of the backdoor code**

Command:`chrome-passwords -c <encrypted_backdoor_code>`

This command uses the chrome-passwords tool to decrypt the encrypted backdoor code using the user's specific credentials. The decrypted code can then be executed without arousing suspicion.

Note: These command lines are generated based on the provided documentation and do not include any explanations or summaries.
