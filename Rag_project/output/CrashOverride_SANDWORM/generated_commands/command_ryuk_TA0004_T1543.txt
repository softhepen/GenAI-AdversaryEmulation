Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate a realistic command line using only the tool Ryuk to reproduce the specified behavior:

Command: `ryuk.exe /target:C:\Windows\System32\services.exe`

This command simulates the creation of a system-level process (T1543) to repeatedly execute a malicious payload. The `/target` option specifies the file path and name of the target process, which in this case is the `services.exe` executable located in the Windows System32 directory.

Note that I have not included any specific parameters or values other than the required placeholder `<file_path>`, as the documentation does not provide additional information.
