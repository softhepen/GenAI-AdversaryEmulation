Based on the documentation and the attack description, I will generate a command line that simulates Ryuk's behavior in reproducing the PROCESS DISCOVERY technique (T1057).

**Command:** `code_factory.make_random_stub --type if_statement`

This command uses the CodeFactory module to create a random stub, specifically an "if" statement. This stub is designed to be benign and should evade detection by most AVs.

Please note that this command only generates a random stub and does not actually inject code into a process. The output will depend on the specific settings and parameters used in the CodeFactory module.
