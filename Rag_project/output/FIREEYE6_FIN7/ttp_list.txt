- Tactic: TA0002 – EXECUTION
  Technique: T1203 – EXPLOITATION FOR CLIENT EXECUTION
  Description: The use of LNK files and VBScript, along with mshta.exe, are methods used to exploit the client system for execution of the malware.
  Technique: T1059 – COMMAND AND SCRIPTING INTERPRETER
  Description: The use of VBScript and mshta.exe demonstrates the application of scripting to achieve malicious goals. This TTP involves the use of PowerShell scripts for execution. The script mentioned is heavily obfuscated and is used to execute shellcode. This TTP involves the use of PowerShell scripts for execution.

  Technique: T1204 – USER EXECUTION
  Description: An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution.
  Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
  Description: how a scheduled task is set up to execute a VBScript file at a specified interval for maintaining persistence on the system.​ creating tasks or jobs that run at specified intervals or times to maintain persistence on the victim system
- Tactic: TA0001 – INITIAL ACCESS
  Technique: T1566 – PHISHING
  Description: targeting individuals or organizations with phishing emails that contain malicious attachments, such as DOCX or RTF files. The goal is to deceive the recipient into opening the attachment and executing the embedded malware.
- Tactic: TA0003 – PERSISTENCE
  Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
  Description: how a scheduled task is set up to execute a VBScript file at a specified interval for maintaining persistence on the system.​ creating tasks or jobs that run at specified intervals or times to maintain persistence on the victim system
  Technique: T1547 – BOOT OR LOGON AUTOSTART EXECUTION
  Description: Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key.
- Tactic: TA0004 – PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
  Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
  Description: how a scheduled task is set up to execute a VBScript file at a specified interval for maintaining persistence on the system.​ creating tasks or jobs that run at specified intervals or times to maintain persistence on the victim system
  Technique: T1547 – BOOT OR LOGON AUTOSTART EXECUTION
  Description: Adversaries may achieve persistence by adding a program to a startup folder or referencing it with a Registry run key.
- Tactic: TA0007 – DISCOVERY
  Technique: T1057 – PROCESS DISCOVERY
  Description: The VBScript is using WMI queries to check if a particular PowerShell script is running, which is an example of process discovery. This technique involves identifying running processes on a system. If the process is not found, the script then starts it, ensuring the required script is active.​ identifying and listing the processes currently running on the victim's system
- Tactic: TA0005 – DEFENSE EVASION
  Technique: T1027 – OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION
  Description: Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit.
  Technique: T1070 – INDICATOR REMOVAL
  Description: the delete function is used to remove specified files
- Tactic: TA0009 – COLLECTION
  Technique: T1018 – REMOTE SYSTEM DISCOVERY
  Description: gathering information about the victim's system, such as operating system details, processor information, BIOS version, and running processes. This is done using WMI queries, which helps the attacker understand the environment and plan further actions.
  Technique: T1082 – SYSTEM INFORMATION DISCOVERY
  Description: Sends victim machine information (OS, Processor, BIOS, and running processes) using WMI queries.
  Technique: T1113 – SCREEN CAPTURE
  Description: capturing screenshots of the victim's desktop
- Tactic: TA0011 – COMMAND AND CONTROL
  Technique: T1573 – ENCRYPTED CHANNEL
  Description: Adversaries may employ an encryption algorithm to conceal command and control traffic rather than relying on any inherent protections provided by a communication protocol.
