Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the described attack behavior.

Command: `chrome-passwords.exe -p`

The above command simulates the user opening a malicious LNK file that executes the chrome-passwords tool without waiting for random input at the end. The output can be redirected to a file like a cmd or vbs script, which would trigger the infection.

Command: `chrome-passwords.exe -c -p`

This command is similar to the previous one but also shows cookies in addition to passwords.

Please note that these commands do not contain any specific parameters (e.g., file paths, ports, registry keys) as they are not explicitly mentioned in the attack description.
