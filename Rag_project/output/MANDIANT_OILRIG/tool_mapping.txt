Here is the analysis output:

- Tactic: TA0011 – COMMAND AND CONTROL
Technique: T1568 – DYNAMIC RESOLUTION
Description: The malware uses a domain generation algorithm to dynamically create command and control (C2) domain names, making it more difficult to block and track.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1008 – FALLBACK CHANNEL
Description: Implementing domain generation algorithm (DGA) for C2 communication.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1105 – INGRESS TOOL TRANSFER
Description: The malware creates a child process (mshta.exe) that downloads a malicious script from an external URL.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1071 – APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL
Description: POWRUNER uses HTTP GET requests to communicate with the C2 server, sending and receiving data to perform its operations.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1132 – DATA ENCODING
Description: Encoding communication and payloads using Base64.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0001 – INITIAL ACCESS
Technique: T1190 – EXPLOIT PUBLIC-FACING APPLICATION
Description: The initial compromise was achieved through the exploitation of a known vulnerability, CVE-2017-0199, which allows remote code execution through a specially crafted file.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1566 – PHISHING
Description: APT34 sent a malicious file as an attachment in a spear-phishing email to the victim organization. This attachment is specifically crafted to exploit a vulnerability once opened by the target, leading to the execution of the malware payload.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0005 – DEFENSE EVASION
Technique: T1211 – EXPLOITATION FOR DEFENSE EVASION
Description: By overwriting the function address with an existing instruction from EQNEDT32.EXE, the malware avoids detection by leveraging legitimate system functions to execute its payload, thus evading security defenses.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1218 – SYSTEM BINARY PROXY EXECUTION
Description: Adversaries may bypass process and/or signature-based defenses by proxying execution of malicious content with signed, or otherwise trusted, binaries.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1140 – DEOBFUSCATE/DECODE FILES OR INFORMATION
Description: The use of Ce%Util.exe to decode base64-encoded files (hUpdateCheckers.base and dUpdateCheckers.base) fits this technique. It's an example of how attackers use legitimate tools to handle encoded data, revealing the actual payload.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1027 – OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION
Description: Adversaries may attempt to make an executable or file difficult to discover or analyze by encrypting, encoding, or otherwise obfuscating its contents on the system or in transit.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1036 – MASQUERADING
Description: Using legitimate-looking filenames.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1070 – INDICATOR REMOVAL
Description: After executing, cUpdateCheckers.bat and the .base files are deleted from the staging directory to remove traces of the malware's presence and reduce detection risk.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0003 – PERSISTENCE
Technique: T1543 – CREATE OR MODIFY SYSTEM PROCESS
Description: The malware uses the WinExec function to create a new process, mshta.exe. The malware uses the WinExec function to create a new process, mshta.exe.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
Description: The creation of the scheduled task for GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs is used to maintain persistence by ensuring the script runs regularly. The GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs script is set up to be launched every minute by the Task Scheduler, ensuring that the scripts dUpdateCheckers.ps1 and hUpdateCheckers.ps1 are executed regularly.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0004 – PRIVILEGE ESCALATION
Technique: T1543 – CREATE OR MODIFY SYSTEM PROCESS
Description: The malware uses the WinExec function to create a new process, mshta.exe. The malware uses the WinExec function to create a new process, mshta.exe.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1053 – SCHEDULED TASK/JOB
Description: The creation of the scheduled task for GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs is used to maintain persistence by ensuring the script runs regularly. The GoogleUpdateschecker.vbs script is set up to be launched every minute by the Task Scheduler, ensuring that the scripts dUpdateCheckers.ps1 and hUpdateCheckers.ps1 are executed regularly.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0007 – DISCOVERY
Technique: T1083 – FILE AND DIRECTORY DISCOVERY
Description: This renaming operation helps the malware to ensure the file is recognized as a script and executed properly.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1082 – SYSTEM INFORMATION DISCOVERY
Description: POWRUNER collects information about the currently logged in user, hostname, network configuration, and other system details through batch commands.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1033 – SYSTEM OWNER/USER DISCOVERY
Description: Enumerating logged-in users and administrator accounts.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0009 – COLLECTION
Technique: T1113 – SCREEN CAPTURE
Description: POWRUNER can receive a command from the C2 server to capture and store a screenshot of the victim's system
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1041 – EXFILTRATION OVER COMMAND AND CONTROL CHANNEL
Description: POWRUNER uses its communication channel with the C2 server to exfiltrate the captured screenshot. This method involves sending data (in this case, the screenshot) back to the C2 server as part of its exfiltration process.
Tool: No tool
