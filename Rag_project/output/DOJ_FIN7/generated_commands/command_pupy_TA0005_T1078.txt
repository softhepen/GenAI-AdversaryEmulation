Here are the command lines that simulate the attack behavior of stealing credentials through surveillance for unauthorized access to sensitive information using only the tool Pupy:

Command: `creddump`

This command retrieves system hashes (Windows/Linux) and stores them in the local database.

Command: `Lazagne`

This command retrieves lots of passwords stored on the system (Windows/Linux), including browser passwords, email client passwords, and other types of credentials.

Command: `loot_memory -b <browser_name>`

This command crawls process memory to find browser passwords (<browser_name>) and stores them in the local database.

Command: `cred` 

This command displays all stored credentials from the local database.

These commands simulate the attack behavior of stealing credentials through surveillance for unauthorized access to sensitive information, corresponding to MITRE technique T1078 (VALID ACCOUNTS) under tactic TA0005 (DEFENSE EVASION).
