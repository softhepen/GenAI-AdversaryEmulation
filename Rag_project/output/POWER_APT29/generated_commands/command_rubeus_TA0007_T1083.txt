Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using **only** the tool Rubeus to reproduce the following attack behavior:

Adversaries may search for files and directories on local and remote systems.

Command: `rubeus ls <directory_path>`

*Replace `<directory_path>` with a valid directory path (e.g., "C:\Users\username", "D:\sharedfolder")*

This command simulates searching for files and directories on the local system.
