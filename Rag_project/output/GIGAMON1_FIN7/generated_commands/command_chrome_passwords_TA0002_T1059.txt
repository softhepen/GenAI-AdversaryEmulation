Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using the chrome-passwords tool to simulate the behavior described.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -c`

This command line uses the `-c` option to show both saved passwords and cookies in a format like: `host_key \n path \n cookie value`.

**Note:** The output of this command will likely contain sensitive information, so please ensure you are working in a secure environment.

Next, I'll simulate the use of Visual Basic scripts (VBS or VBE) to execute malicious code within the victim system:

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -p > file.vbs`

This command line uses the `-p` option to disable waiting for random input at the end, allowing us to forward the output to a file. The `> file.vbs` part redirects the output to a file named `file.vbs`, which will contain the decrypted passwords and cookies.

**Command:** `cscript //nologo file.vbs`

This command line uses the `cscript` command to execute the `file.vbs` script, which was generated by the previous command. The `//nologo` option suppresses the Windows Script Host logo from appearing during execution.

Please let me know if these command lines meet your requirements or if you need further assistance!
