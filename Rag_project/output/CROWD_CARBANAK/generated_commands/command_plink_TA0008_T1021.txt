Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will construct a command line that simulates using RDP to access and control the victim's system.

Command: `plink.exe -no-antispoof -R 3389:localhost:3389 <victim_machine_ip>`

This command uses the Plink tool to establish a connection to the victim machine's RDP service (port 3389) and forward it to the local machine. The `<victim_machine_ip>` placeholder represents the IP address of the victim machine.

Note that I did not include any authentication credentials, as they are not explicitly mentioned in the attack description. Additionally, I used the `-no-antispoof` option to disable antispoofing, which is necessary for RDP connections.

The command line accurately reproduces the behavior described in the attack description and corresponds to the MITRE technique T1021 (REMOTE SERVICES) and tactic TA0008 (LATERAL MOVEMENT).
