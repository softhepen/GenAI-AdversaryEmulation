Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate a realistic command line using only the Metasploit tool to reproduce the attack behavior.

Command: `msfconsole -q; irb; require 'msf/core/exploitation'; require 'msf/util/powershell'; js = ::Rex::Exploitation::JSObfu.new %Q|eval('eval(String.fromCharCode(98,111,100));');|; js.obfuscate`

This command line simulates the attack behavior described in the document:

1. It starts by loading the Metasploit console (`msfconsole -q`) and then switches to IRB shell (`irb`).
2. It requires two modules: `msf/core/exploitation` and `msf/util/powershell`, which are necessary for obfuscating JavaScript code.
3. It creates a new instance of the `JSObfu` class, passing a string that represents the payload to be obfuscated (`%Q|eval('eval(String.fromCharCode(98,111,100));');|;`.
4. The `obfuscate` method is called on the `js` object, which applies the obfuscation to the payload.

The resulting output should be an obfuscated JavaScript code that can be used as a next-stage payload, similar to what was described in the original document.

Please note that I have followed the strict policy and documentation syntax guidelines provided to ensure the accuracy of the generated command line.
