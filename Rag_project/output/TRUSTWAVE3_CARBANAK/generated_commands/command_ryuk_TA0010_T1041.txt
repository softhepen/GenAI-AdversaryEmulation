Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool Ryuk to reproduce the exfiltration of data over a command and control channel.

Command: `ryuk.exe --disconnect-shares`

This command is used to disconnect shares, which could be a precursor to exfiltrating data. The adversary may use this option to prepare the system for further exploitation.

Command: `ryuk.exe -e`

The `-e` option is used to confirm that the user wants to encrypt the system. This could be an indication that the adversary is preparing to exfiltrate sensitive data or files.

Command: `ryuk.exe --drop-bat-files`

This command drops kill.bat and window.bat into C:/Users/Public, which may be used for network share discovery or other malicious purposes.

These commands simulate the initial steps of the attack, setting up the system for further exploitation and data exfiltration.
