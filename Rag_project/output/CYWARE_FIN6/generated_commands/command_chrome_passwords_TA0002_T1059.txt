Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate a realistic command line using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the encoded command through PowerShell behavior.

Command: `chrome-passwords -c`

This command uses the `-c` option to show also cookies in addition to saved passwords. The output will include URL, username, password, and cookie information.
