Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the Ryuk tool to simulate the SCREEN CAPTURE behavior.

**Command:** `ryuk.exe --drop-bat-files`

This command line simulates the network share discovery step of the Ryuk ransomware, which is a prerequisite for capturing compromised system screenshots. The `--drop-bat-files` option drops kill.bat and window.bat into C:/Users/Public, allowing the tool to perform network share discovery.

**Command:** `ryuk.exe -e`

This command line simulates the confirmation of wanting to encrypt the system, which is a critical step in the Ryuk ransomware's behavior. The `-e` option confirms that the system should be encrypted.

Please let me know if these command lines meet the requirements or if I need to generate more.
