Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using the **chrome-passwords** tool to simulate the attack behavior.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -p <stolen_credentials>`

This command uses the `-p` option to extract locally saved passwords and cookies from Google Chrome. `<stolen_credentials>` represents the stolen credentials obtained by tools like Mimikatz, LaZagne, or Kerbrute.

Please note that I will not provide any actual stolen credentials in this example, as it is a fictional scenario. In a real-world attack, you would use the actual stolen credentials obtained from the compromised system.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -p <stolen_credentials> -o <output_file>`

This command uses the `-o` option to specify an output file for the extracted passwords and cookies.

**Command:** `chrome-passwords -p <stolen_credentials> -o <output_file> -d`

This command uses the `-d` option to decrypt the extracted passwords and cookies.
