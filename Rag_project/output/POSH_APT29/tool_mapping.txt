Here is the analysis:

- Tactic: TA0002 – EXECUTION
Technique: T1047 – WINDOWS MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTATION
Description: The use of WMI to maintain persistence on the system. POSHSPY leverages WMI as one of the main tools. The use of WMI to execute commands in order to avoid detection.
Tool: wmic

Technique: T1059 – COMMAND AND SCRIPTING INTERPRETER
Description: The use of PowerShell to execute malicious commands or scripts. POSHSPY uses PowerShell as part of its toolkit. The use of PowerShell payloads allows only legitimate system processes to be used, making detection of malicious code more difficult. Using PowerShell to run the backdoor Running PowerShell commands to read, decrypt, and execute the backdoor code. Run additional PowerShell code. Run additional PowerShell code.
Tool: chrome-passwords

Technique: T1106 – NATIVE API
Description: Creating a new WMI class and adding a text property.
Tool: rubeus

- Tactic: TA0003 – PERSISTENCE
Technique: T1546 – EVENT TRIGGERED EXECUTION
Description: The use of WMI to maintain persistence on the system. POSHSPY uses WMI to store and persist the backdoor code. Creating a WMI event subscription to run the backdoor.
Tool: rubeus

- Tactic: TA0005 – DEFENDE EVASION
Technique: T1027 – OBFUSCATED FILES OR INFORMATION
Description: Obfuscation of traffic and data. PowerShell code is encrypted and encoded in base64. Decryption of the backdoor code.
Tool: chrome-passwords

Technique: T1546 – EVENT TRIGGERED EXECUTION
Description: Creating a WMI event subscription to run the backdoor.
Tool: rubeus

Technique: T1564 – HIDE ARTIFACTS
Description: Adversaries may attempt to hide artifacts associated with their behaviors to evade detection.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1036 – MASQUERADING
Description: This technique involves masking executable files with names and paths that seem legitimate or familiar to the user, such as using file names that correspond to random directory names under Program Files.
Tool: ryuk

Technique: T1070 – INDICATOR REMOVAL
Description: This TTP describes the action of modifying or manipulating file timestamps to hide malware activities, making it more difficult to detect and analyze operations performed on the system.
Tool: No tool

- Tactic: TA0011 – COMMAND AND CONTROL
Technique: T1105 – INGRESS TOOL TRANSFER
Description: Download additional code to execute. Download additional code to execute.
Tool: paexec

Technique: T1573 – ENCRYPTED CHANNEL
Description: to the use of asymmetric encryption algorithms, such as RSA, and symmetric encryption algorithms, such as AES, to protect communications, making it more difficult for defenders to monitor and intercept communications.
Tool: chrome-passwords

Technique: T1568 – DYNAMIC RESOLUTION
Description: dynamically generate a list of command and control (C2) domains on the fly, making it more difficult for defenders to block or detect C2 domains because they are randomly or pseudo-randomly generated.
Tool: No tool

Technique: T1071 – APPLICATION LAYER PROTOCOL
Description: POSHSPY uses custom or system-derived User Agent strings and employs custom or randomly generated cookie names and values
Tool: No tool
