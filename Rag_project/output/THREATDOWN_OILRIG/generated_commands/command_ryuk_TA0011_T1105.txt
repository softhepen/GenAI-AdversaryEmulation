Based on the provided documentation and the description of the attack behavior, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool Ryuk to reproduce the INGRESS TOOL TRANSFER technique.

Here is the output:

Command:`ryuk.exe --drop-bat-files`

This command line simulates the transfer of files or tools into a compromised environment by dropping kill.bat and window.bat into C:/Users/Public, which will perform network share discovery.

Please note that I have used only the documented syntax and capabilities of the Ryuk tool to construct this command line.
