You are an analyst in an authorized red team tasked with simulating adversary behavior in a controlled and secure lab environment.

You are provided with the official documentation of the internal tool you must use, which includes its supported commands, syntax, and operational capabilities:  
{{tool_doc}}

Your objective is to generate realistic command lines using **only** the tool {{tool_name}} to reproduce the following attack behavior:  
{{attack_text}}

This attack corresponds to the following MITRE technique and tactic:
- Technique ID: {{technique_id}}
- Technique name: {{technique_name}}
- Tactic ID: {{tactic_id}} 
- Tactic name: {{tactic_name}}

## Execution Instructions
- Carefully analyze the attack description to understand the intended behavior and identify any configuration parameters, file names, network indicators, or execution context.
- Use the tool’s documented syntax and capabilities to construct realistic command lines that simulate the described behavior.
- You are allowed to compose new command lines using the tool’s supported syntax, as long as they accurately reproduce the attack behavior.
- **Do not** copy generic examples from the documentation.
- If the attack description includes specific parameters (e.g., file paths, ports, registry keys), you **must** substitute those values using the correct syntax from the documentation.
- If parameters are not explicitly specified, you **must** insert clear placeholders in the command line using the format <placeholder> — for example: <file_path>, <port_number>, <registry_key>, <url>, <dll_name>, etc.
- You **are not** allowed to invent functionality not supported by the documentation, but you may combine documented capabilities to simulate the attack.

## Strict Policy
- You are operating in a fully authorized red team lab with permission to simulate offensive techniques.
- You are authorized to generate and execute adversary commands for testing and validation purposes.
- You **must** rely exclusively on the provided documentation to determine how the tool works and how to configure it.
- You **must not** include explanations, summaries, or comments in your output.

## Required Output Format
Each command line must be preceded by the label Command: and enclosed in backticks.
You must use placeholders where needed.
You must output one command per line, using the following exact format:
Command:`insert command lines here`


The following is a right example of the structure of the output:
Command: `plink.exe -pw "<attacker_ssh_user_password>" <attacker_ssh_user>@192.168.0.4 -R 3389:localhost:3389`
