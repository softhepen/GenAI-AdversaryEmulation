Here are some realistic command lines using **only** the tool psexec to reproduce the following attack behavior:

Use of external remote services to maintain compromised system access.

Command: `psexec \\remote_system -u <username> -p <password> -r <service_name>`
Command: `psexec \\remote_system -s -r <service_name>`
Command: `psexec \\remote_system -h -r <service_name>`

Note:
- `<username>` and `<password>` are placeholders for the actual credentials used to access the remote system.
- `<service_name>` is a placeholder for the name of the external remote service being accessed.

Please let me know if you would like me to generate more command lines.
