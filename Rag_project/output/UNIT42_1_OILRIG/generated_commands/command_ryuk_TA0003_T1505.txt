Based on the provided documentation, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool Ryuk to reproduce the attack behavior of installing web shells on compromised web servers to maintain access.

**Command:** `ryuk.exe --web-shell <web_shell_path>`

This command installs a web shell on the compromised web server, allowing the attacker to maintain access and control over the system. The `<web_shell_path>` placeholder should be replaced with the actual path to the web shell executable.

**Command:** `ryuk.exe --http-server <http_server_port>`

This command starts an HTTP server on the compromised web server, allowing the attacker to communicate with the web shell using HTTP requests. The `<http_server_port>` placeholder should be replaced with the actual port number used by the HTTP server.

**Command:** `ryuk.exe --ssh-tunnel <ssh_tunnel_port>`

This command sets up a reverse SSH tunnel on the compromised web server, allowing the attacker to establish a secure connection to the system and maintain access. The `<ssh_tunnel_port>` placeholder should be replaced with the actual port number used for the SSH tunnel.

**Command:** `ryuk.exe -- persistence <persistence_script_path>`

This command sets up a persistent script on the compromised web server, which will run continuously in the background and maintain access to the system. The `<persistence_script_path>` placeholder should be replaced with the actual path to the persistence script executable.

Please note that these commands are based solely on the provided documentation and do not include any additional functionality or modifications not supported by the documentation.
