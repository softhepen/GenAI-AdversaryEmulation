Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate a realistic command line using **only** the Metasploit tool to simulate the attack behavior.

Here is my output:

Command: `msfconsole -r <task_database_file>`

In this command, `<task_database_file>` represents the database file where the attacker uploads "tasks" for Cozyduke to execute. This command simulates the upload of tasks to the database file, allowing Cozyduke to receive commands and control instructions.

Note: I did not include any specific values for the task database file as it was not provided in the attack description.
