Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the TrickBot's pwgrab module behavior.

Here is the output:

Command: `chrome-passwords`

This command recovers locally saved passwords and cookies (with -p) on Google Chrome without any argument.

To simulate the credential grabbing behavior, I will use the following command lines:

Command: `chrome-passwords -c`

This command shows also cookies as follows: host_key \n path \n cookie value, simulating the extraction of cookies from the victim's browser.

Command: `chrome-passwords -p > output.txt`

This command disables waiting for random input at the end and saves the output to a file named "output.txt", simulating the exfiltration of extracted credentials.

Please note that I have not invented any functionality not supported by the documentation, but rather combined documented capabilities to simulate the attack behavior.
