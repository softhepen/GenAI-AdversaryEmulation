Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using only the tool chrome-passwords to reproduce the following attack behavior:

**Extracting email from MS Exchange servers using compromised credentials**

Here is the output in the required format:

Command: `chrome-passwords -p <file_path_to_chrome_user_data>`

This command extracts locally saved passwords and cookies (with -p) on Google Chrome, which includes the decrypted emails stored by the user.

Note: `<file_path_to_chrome_user_data>` should be replaced with the actual path to the user's Chrome data directory, where the SQLite3 DB file containing the encrypted passwords is located.
